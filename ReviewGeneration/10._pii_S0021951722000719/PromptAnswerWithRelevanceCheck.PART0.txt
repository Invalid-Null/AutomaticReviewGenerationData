<Answer>

 Unfortunately this literature does not provide sufficient information to directly answer the specific questions asked. The article is focused on experimental and computational studies of gallium oxide nanoparticle catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide substantial background information or reviews of prior work on propane dehydrogenation catalysis and mechanisms in general. Since the questions seem to be requesting a broad overview of the field that is beyond the scope of this one specific paper, I cannot provide direct quotes or summaries from the literature to comprehensively address them. Please let me know if you would like me to attempt to answer any of the questions based on my own general knowledge instead of being limited to the content of this article. I apologize that the literature provided does not contain enough relevant details to respond to the questions as formatted.

 Unfortunately this literature does not provide sufficient information to directly answer the questions asked. It focuses on describing experimental methods and results related to studying different gallium oxide nanoparticle catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide broader background or context about propane dehydrogenation catalysis research and applications. Since there are no relevant quotes from the literature, I will respond "No relevant quotes" for each question.
