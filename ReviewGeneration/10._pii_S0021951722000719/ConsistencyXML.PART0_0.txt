To generate the consistency ratios, I compared each answer file's English version answer to the correct English answers provided. For answer.PART0_0.txt, there was no attempt made to directly answer the questions so I put "Unable to determine". For the other answer files, the responses accurately stated that the literature did not contain relevant information to answer the questions, so I put 100% to indicate complete consistency with the correct answers.

The XML structure follows the requested format with a <questions> root element containing <question> elements for each question number. The <question> elements contain <answer> elements with the filename and consistency ratio percentage for each answer file. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requests!
