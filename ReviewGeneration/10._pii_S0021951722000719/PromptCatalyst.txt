Abstract
Three γ/β-Ga2O3 nanoparticle catalysts that differ in the relative ratio of γ-Ga2O3 to β-Ga2O3 were prepared to evaluate the effect of H2 treatment (500 °C, 2 h) on the coordination environment of bulk and surface Ga sites, Lewis acidity and catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Independent of the H2 treatment, the initial PDH activity of the γ/β-Ga2O3 catalysts increases with the fraction of the β-Ga2O3 phase. This is explained by the presence of weak Lewis acid sites (LAS) in β-Ga2O3 while such sites are absent in γ-Ga2O3. Treatment with H2 increases the catalytic activity of all three γ/β-Ga2O3 catalysts but for different reasons. For catalysts with higher fractions of β-Ga2O3, H2 treatment increases further the relative abundance of weak LAS, likely by generating coordinatively unsaturated Ga sites (such as tricoordinated Ga sites nearby oxygen vacancies). In contrast, H2 treatment of a catalyst containing a predominant fraction of γ-Ga2O3 phase induces disorder in the sub-surface structure of the nanoparticle, that is, it forms gallium and oxygen vacancies in the bulk and favors migration of gallium, and likely also of oxygen, to the surface. This induces a surface reconstruction that notably increases the fraction of strong LAS (and proportionally decreases the fraction of medium LAS), while creating no weak LAS in γ-Ga2O3-H2. Therefore, the increase in the catalytic activity of H2-treated γ-Ga2O3 is explained by the higher density of surface Ga sites in γ-Ga2O3-H2 relative to calcined γ-Ga2O3. H2-treated catalysts that contain a higher relative amount of weak LAS also feature a higher relative abundance of gallium hydride species associated with a low frequency FTIR band at ca. 1931–1939 cm−1, that is, weak LAS likely give weakly-bound hydrides in β-Ga2O3. Our results highlight that weak LAS in unsupported Ga2O3 catalysts are more active in PDH than mild or strong LAS.

1. Introduction
Gallium oxide (gallia) is considered as an alternative material to the industrial CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst (Catofin process) for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH). [1], [2] A gallia-based catalyst formulation that is close to industrial implementation is PtGa/Al2O3 (FCDh process) and it has been argued that Ga2O3 may be the active phase in this type of catalysts, while Pt serves merely as a promoter, [3] although counterevidence for Pt-based active sites has also been reported. [4], [5], [6] However, the atomic structure of the gallia sites that are most active for PDH has yet to be established. A recent study has suggested that weak Lewis acid sites (LAS) drive PDH activity of β-Ga2O3 and, based on DFT calculations, these weak LAS have been ascribed to coordinatively unsaturated (Mcus) tricoordinated Ga sites (GaIII) in the vicinity of an oxygen vacancy (Vo). [7] In addition, weak Ga-based LAS have shown to be essential for selective PDH in mixed oxide (Ga,Al)2O3 catalysts; [8] in addition, weakly acidic extra-framework Ga-oxo clusters have been proposed to be responsible for the alkane dehydrogenation activity of Ga-modified high-silica zeolites. [9], [10]
H2 pre-treatment of poorly reducible oxides such as Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2 or W2O3 was suggested to generate Mcus metal sites in those materials and yield PDH active catalysts. [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17] While H2 pre-treatment may generate surface Vo sites in the stated oxides (and thereby produces Mcus sites), an alternative scenario that can proceed during H2 treatment is surface reconstruction. More specifically, oxygen can diffuse from the bulk towards the surface, leading to an increased density of Vo sites in the bulk and a reduced number of oxygen vacancies at the surface, and hence also a decreased number of Mcus sites. [18], [19]
In view of these different scenarios, the aim of this work is to assess the effect of H2 treatment (500 °C, 2 h) on the surface and bulk sites of three gallia nanoparticle (NP) PDH catalysts. Overall, the catalytic performance of the gallia catalysts may depend on the extent of the surface reduction, which is likely to influence their Lewis acidity properties. The catalysts contain varying ratios of γ/β gallia phases, as determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and pair distribution function (PDF) analyses. Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis) and dynamic nuclear polarization surface enhanced NMR spectroscopy (DNP SENS) [20], [21] using 15N pyridine as a probe molecule indicate that H2 treatment generates Vo sites (surface and bulk) in a β-rich Ga2O3 catalyst and forms Gacus (GaIII) surface sites leading to an increased relative fraction of weak LAS and in turn a higher PDH activity of the H2-treated γ/β-Ga2O3 catalysts. Interestingly, H2 treatment of γ-phase Ga2O3 NPs creates bulk Vo sites, giving rise to a disordered bulk structure and a surface reconstruction. This reconstructed surface has a higher density of Ga sites, which may explain the increased PDH activity of H2-treated γ-phase Ga2O3. However, weak LAS are detected neither in the calcined nor the H2-treated γ-rich Ga2O3 materials, and this correlates with a lower PDH activity of these catalysts relative to Ga2O3 NPs rich in the β-gallia phase (calcined or H2-treated).
2. Experimental details
2.1. Synthesis
Nanocrystalline γ-Ga2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by an established colloidal approach using gallium acetylacetonate and oleylamine. [22] Specifically, Ga(acac)3 (2 g, 5.4 mmol, 99.99+%, Strem Chemicals) and 40 mL of C18H35NH2 (≥98%, Sigma–Aldrich) were stirred at 90 °C for 1 h under dynamic vacuum (ca. 10−1 mbar) in a 100 mL three-neck, round-bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser, thermocouple and connected to a Schlenk line. This was followed by heating to 200, 250 or 300 °C (3 °C min−1 under N2 flow and stirring) for 7, 12 or 16 h, respectively. The reaction mixtures were subsequently cooled down to room temperature, dissolved in a 3:1 mixture (volume ratio) of toluene and ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich; ≥99.5% and ≥99.8%, respectively, ca. 35 mL) and centrifuged at 6500 rpm. The precipitate was redispersed in a toluene-ethanol mixture and the centrifugation-redispersion step was repeated four times. The precipitated gel (ca. 25% yield based on thermogravimetric analysis) was dispersed in toluene (ca. 20 mL) and the resulting solution was dried overnight at 110 °C, yielding oleylamine-capped Ga2O3 NPs as a powder. Calcination of the as-synthesized gallia NPs in a muffle furnace at 600 °C (3 °C min−1, 2 h) gave calcined materials denoted Ga2O3(200), Ga2O3(250) and Ga2O3(300), with the respective synthesis temperature indicated by the subscript in parenthesis. The reductive treatment of the calcined gallia nanoparticles (ca. 150 mg) was performed in a fixed-bed quartz reactor (13 mm OD) under H2 at 500 °C (10 °C min−1, 50 mL min−1, 2 h). This reductive treatment gave materials denoted as Ga2O3(200)–H2, Ga2O3(250)–H2 and Ga2O3(300)–H2. A β-Ga2O3(750) reference was obtained by calcining Ga2O3(200) at 750 °C for 2 h. The structures of β-Ga2O3(750) and Ga2O3(200) have been described by us previously. [23]
2.2. Methods
Details of the fixed bed catalytic tests for PDH, XRD and PDF analyses, high-angle annular dark field scanning electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), UV–Vis, Ga K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), 15N DNP SENS, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and N2 physisorption data are reported in the Supporting Information.
3. Results
3.1. Materials
Nanocrystalline gallia nanoparticles were obtained by adjusting the synthesis temperature and time at 200, 250 or 300 °C for 7, 12 or 16 h, respectively (Fig. 1A and Figure S1). Calcination in air at 600 °C yielded materials denoted as Ga2O3(200), Ga2O3(250) and Ga2O3(300). Treatment of these materials at 500 °C in a flow of pure H2 (50 mL min−1, 2 h) gave Ga2O3(200)–H2, Ga2O3(250)–H2 and Ga2O3(300)–H2 (Fig. 1A). H2 treatment induced a color change from white (calcined Ga2O3 nanoparticles) to pale yellow (Figure S2), consistent with their UV–Vis spectra (Figure S3, vide infra). When exposed to air, the color of the H2-treated gallia NPs remained unchanged for ca. four weeks and after this time, the color gradually changed back to white, within ca. six weeks. Because of this relative stability of the Ga2O3–H2 NPs in air, we have performed their characterization in an air atmosphere (unless specified otherwise), but always within 48 h after their first exposure to air.

3.2. Morphology, surface area, Ga content
Table S5 summarizes (i) the particle size distribution (PSD) of the as-synthesized colloidal gallia materials (obtained from TEM data, Figure S4), as well as (ii) the specific surface areas (SBET) and (iii) the Ga wt% content (ICP-OES) of the calcined and H2-treated nanoparticles. The average sizes of the colloidal gallia nanoparticles, as determined by TEM analysis, are 2.5(6), 4.7(7) and 5.6(8) nm for Ga2O3(200), Ga2O3(250) and Ga2O3(300), respectively, i.e. higher synthesis temperatures and longer holding times lead to a larger particle size. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis of the N2 physisorption data shows that the surface area of calcined Ga2O3(300) is 159 m2 g−1, which is higher than that of Ga2O3(250) and Ga2O3(200) (122 and 98 m2 g−1, respectively). Comparison of the average particle sizes with the respective BET surface areas suggests that calcination-induced agglomeration is highest in Ga2O3(200) and lowest in Ga2O3(300). H2 treatment leads to a decrease in surface area, i.e. the SBET of Ga2O3(200)–H2, Ga2O3(250)–H2 and Ga2O3(300)–H2 are 72, 87 and 101 m2 g−1, i.e. a decrease of, respectively, ca. 27%, 29% and 37% after H2 treatment. The gallium content (Ga wt%), determined by ICP-OES, shows very similar values and ranges between 68 and 70% for all of the six materials studied here (calcined and H2-treated, Table S5).
3.3. UV–Vis
The band gap energies of the prepared materials are determined by Tauc plots of the UV–Vis spectra (Figure S5 and S3, respectively). [24], [25] Ga2O3(200), Ga2O3(250) and Ga2O3(300) show similar band gap energies of 4.1, 4.3 and 4.2 eV, respectively (Table S5). These values are close to the reported band gap in γ-Ga2O3 quantum dots (4.5 eV), [26] and are below the reported band gap of β-Ga2O3 (4.8–4.9 eV). [27] The H2-treated Ga2O3 NPs, which were exposed to atmospheric air before measurement, display a red shift of UV–Vis absorption relative to calcined Ga2O3 NPs (Figure S3), and an absorption tail that extents into the visible region likely relates to the sub-bandgap absorption by the deep defect states (Vo sites). [28], [29], [30] Consequently, the H2-treated Ga2O3 NPs have significantly lower band gaps, viz. 3.4, 3.9 and 3.9 eV for Ga2O3(200)–H2, Ga2O3(250)–H2 and Ga2O3(300)–H2, respectively (Figure S5, Table S5), consistent with formation of discrete intra-band gap energy states in the reduced materials due to Vo sites. [31], [32]
3.4. XRD and PDF analyses
Diffractograms of the three as-synthesized Ga2O3 NPs (before calcination) show broad peaks that are attributed to the metastable γ-Ga2O3 phase (Figure S6). The patterns of the calcined gallia NPs (black) also display broad peaks due to γ-Ga2O3 (Figure S7). [33] However, the diffractogram of Ga2O3(200) shows subtle features of the β-Ga2O3 phase at 2θ of ca. 32, 46, 48 and 57° (red asterisks in Figure S7), indicating a partial phase transformation from γ-Ga2O3 to β-Ga2O3 after calcination at 600 °C. The irreversible γ → β (bulk) transformation has been reported to take place at temperatures above 600 °C. [33] However, we have also observed previously that already at temperatures close to 300 °C the local structure (<1 nm range) of Ga2O3(200) undergoes a transformation leading to the formation of small β-Ga2O3 domains at such temperatures. [23]
Thus, the XRD results suggest that the conditions of the colloidal synthesis (temperature and reaction duration) influence the extent to which γ-Ga2O3 transforms into β-Ga2O3 during calcination, i.e. Ga2O3(200) > Ga2O3(250) > Ga2O3(300). This is possibly due to the difference in the particle sizes of the as-synthesized γ-Ga2O3 NPs as observed by TEM (Table S5). H2 treatment does not lead to any notable changes in the diffractograms (Figure S7, blue traces).
Complementary insight into the nanocrystalline structure of the calcined and/or H2-treated materials was obtained using PDF analysis (synchrotron-based data). [23] The PDF of the as-synthesized materials is similar to previous reports on γ-Ga2O3 that have shown that this phase exhibits an intrinsic high degree of disorder (Fig. 1B). [23] The peak at ca. 1.9 Å is due to Ga–O pairs (Table S2) and its position is determined by the average Ga–O interatomic distances, that depend on the relative abundances (and asymmetry) of the GaO4 and GaO6 polyhedra in the gallia phases, while the peaks in the region 2.7–4.0 Å are dominated by Ga–Ga pairs of the GaO4 and GaO6 polyhedra.
Despite the initial crystalline structure of the NPs is similar among the three studied as-synthesized catalysts (i.e. γ-Ga2O3), after calcination these materials undergo changes to a different extent due to a partial γ → β transformation at 600 °C (in line with XRD observations). This can be seen in Fig. 1B, which plots difference curves (d-PDF), i.e. the PDF data of the as-synthesized materials is subtracted from that of the respective calcined nanoparticles. The degree of γ → β transformation (i.e. higher β-phase content) follows the trend: Ga2O3(300) < Ga2O3(250) < Ga2O3(200). This trend is also confirmed by the characteristic peak splitting at ca. 7.9 Å and 10.5 Å, linked to the emergence of β-Ga2O3 in the structure (marked by red rectangles in Fig. 1B). [7], [23] To quantify the extent of phase transformation for each catalyst during calcination, the mid-range of the PDF data (5–17 Å which contains information on the average structure of the materials) was fitted using γ- and β-Ga2O3 models. [34], [35] The fitting results (Figure S8) show atomic percentages of β-Ga2O3 of ca. 40%, 30% and 20% for Ga2O3(200), Ga2O3(250) and Ga2O3(300), respectively. The average crystallite sizes were also obtained from such fittings. We observe increases in the crystallite sizes from ca. 2.4 to 3 nm in Ga2O3(300), and from ca. 2.8 to 3.4 nm in Ga2O3(250) and Ga2O3(200).
An additional (laboratory-based) PDF analysis was carried out to identify possible structural differences between the calcined and H2-treated materials (Figures S9, S10 and Table S2). The PDF analysis shows that there are no considerable structural changes during H2 treatment, yet we can observe slight variations in the range of ca. 3.1–3.5 Å that are possibly related to an increased degree of disorder after H2 treatment.
3.5. Ga K-edge XAS
The coordination and the local structure of Ga in calcined and H2-treated Ga2O3 nanoparticles were probed by Ga K-edge XAS that originates from the 1s → 4p transition and is sensitive to the geometry of the Ga–O coordination. The features at ca. 10376 eV and 10379 eV in the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of the Ga2O3 NPs studied have been attributed to four- (GaIV) and six-coordinated (GaVI) sites, respectively. [36] The XANES spectra of the calcined (black) and H2-treated (blue) materials are presented in Figure S11. The XANES features, i.e. the positions of the GaIV and GaVI features are similar in the studied materials. Ga2O3(250) has the highest intensity, compared to Ga2O3(200) and Ga2O3(300), particularly for the feature at 10379 eV, possibly related to a higher Ga−O coordination number in this material. After H2 treatment we observe a systematic decrease in the white line intensity in all of the H2-treated materials compared to the calcined materials, suggesting a change in the local structure of Ga, in line with results of EXAFS and EELS analyses (vide infra). The decrease of the white line intensity in the XANES spectra of the H2-treated materials can be related to a decrease in the Ga−O coordination number as determined by EXAFS (vide infra) likely due to a more defective structure.
Figure S11 presents non-phase-corrected Fourier transform (FT) plots of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data. EXAFS fittings of the calcined and H2-treated materials are presented in Figure S12 and fitting results are reported in Table S3. We fitted the FT data between 1 and 3 Å using a simplified model composed of one Ga–O and two Ga–Ga paths. It should be noted that these fits represent only an average structure since a mixture of γ and β phases is present in the studied materials and hence a distribution of Ga–O and Ga–Ga distances occur in the fitted range. The average coordination numbers (CN) of the Ga–O and Ga–Ga shells show a slight decrease in the H2-treated catalysts which suggests that H2 treatment induces disorder in the local structure for all catalysts (Figure S12, Table S3).
3.6. EELS
Electron energy loss spectroscopy at the O K-edge was used to characterize Ga2O3(300) (as synthesized and calcined) and Ga2O3(300)–H2. We have chosen Ga2O3(300) for EELS analysis because it shows the highest content of the γ-Ga2O3 phase, which makes the interpretation of structural transformations induced by H2 treatment easier as it is not influenced notably by the phase transition (γ → β). For benchmarking, the β-Ga2O3(750) reference was analyzed as well. The EELS spectra in Fig. 1C show two peaks owing to the hybridization of the O 2p and Ga 4s states (at ca. 536 eV) and O 2p and Ga 4p states (at ca. 541 eV). The broad feature at ca. 560 eV is attributed to the multiple-scattering of electrons. [37] The peak at ca. 536 eV has a similar shape and intensity for all materials except for Ga2O3(300)–H2 for which a lower intensity and peak broadening is observed. The peak at ca. 541 eV is more well-defined in calcined Ga2O3(300) relative to as-synthesized Ga2O3(300), and it also shifts to ca. 540.5 eV in Ga2O3(300). This peak shifts further to ca. 539.9 eV in Ga2O3(300)–H2. In contrast, this peak is found at higher energies of ca. 541.5 eV in β-Ga2O3(750). In general, Ga2O3(300)–H2 features broader and lower intensity peaks at ca. 536 and 540 eV relative to the other three materials studied here. Noteworthy, Ga2O3(300)–H2 contains a pre-edge feature at ca. 530 eV that is not found in any of the other three materials (Fig. 1C, Figure S13). Such a pre-edge feature might be due to new energy states in the band gap (i.e. Vo sites) that are created during the H2 treatment. [38]
Lastly, we compared the EELS spectra of Ga2O3(300)–H2 exposed to air for either less than two days or three months. The material that has been exposed to air for 3 months features an EELS spectrum that is very similar to that of Ga2O3(300), consistent with a re-oxidation of the material during the prolonged exposure to air (Figure S14).
3.7. HAADF-STEM
We have reported previously, using HAADF-STEM analysis, that Ga2O3(200) NPs contain in the surface layers a higher fraction of Ga sites in octahedral crystallographic positions compared to bulk sites. In addition, small crystallites of the β-Ga2O3 phase have been observed previously by HAADF-STEM in Ga2O3(200). [23] Here, we additionally characterize Ga2O3(300) and Ga2O3(300)–H2 by HAADF-STEM imaging because these materials show the lowest content of the β-Ga2O3 phase, as observed by XRD and PDF, and because Ga2O3(300)–H2 exhibits a notable disorder, relative to Ga2O3(300), (according to EXAFS analysis). [23] HAADF-STEM imaging of Ga2O3(300) reveals particles with well-defined edges and a crystalline core (Fig. 1D). In contrast, Ga2O3(300)–H2 features a more disordered core (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, the edge regions become more ordered during H2 treatment. Plotting the intensities of the atomic columns along the [111] planes reveal a higher occupancy of GaVI positions in the surface layers of Ga2O3(300)–H2 as compared to Ga2O3(300). In contrast, there is a decrease in the site occupancy in subsurface layers of Ga2O3(300)–H2 compared to Ga2O3(300) (Fig. 1F-G). These data show that the surface layers in Ga2O3(300)–H2 become denser, and therefore more ordered relative to Ga2O3(300).
3.8. Dissociation of H2
The heterolytic dissociation of hydrogen over Ga–O bonds yielding gallium hydrides and hydroxyl groups was studied by DRIFTS. Here, the calcined NPs were dehydroxylated overnight in an in situ cell (Praying Mantis, Harrick) at 550 °C at ca. 10–4 mbar (measured at the cell outlet). Subsequently, pure H2 was flowed through the cell for 2 h (15 mL min−1) at 500 °C and IR spectra were collected. The cell was evacuated at 550 °C at ca. 10–4 mbar for ca. 2 h and the spectrum of the outgassed specimen acquired.
Fig. 2 presents parts of the full IR spectra focusing on the regions of Ga–OH (3800–3200 cm−1) and Ga–H vibrations (2100–1900 cm−1). [39], [40] For dehydroxylated Ga2O3 NPs, the region of the Ga hydroxyl groups (ca. 3800–3500 cm−1) contains three main bands at ca. 3727, 3690 and 3629 cm−1 (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the intensity of the band at ca. 3727 cm−1 increases in the following order: Ga2O3(200) < Ga2O3(250) < Ga2O3(300). Bands at ca. 3690 and 3629 cm−1 show similar intensities in all of the three materials studied. The band at ca. 3727 cm−1 has been related to terminal OH groups bonded to tetrahedral Ga surface sites. [41], [42] H2 treatment does not lead to major changes of this band for Ga2O3(300)–H2 and Ga2O3(250)–H2, while the band disappears almost entirely in Ga2O3(200)–H2. According to the literature, the sharp Ga–OH band at ca. 3727 cm−1 has been observed mainly in γ-Ga2O3 spinel materials and related to the presence of cation vacancies in nonstoichiometric spinels. [41] In contrast, broader bands at lower frequencies have been ascribed to hydroxyls bonded to Ga sites located on terraces. [43] After H2 treatment (Fig. 2B), the band at ca. 3687 cm−1 largely disappears in all of the materials, except for Ga2O3(200)–H2.

Fig. 2. FTIR spectra of the Ga hydroxyls region (3800–3400 cm−1) after evacuation at 550 °C for 2 h (A) and subsequent H2 treatment at 500 °C for 2 h (B). (C) Fitted FTIR spectra of the Ga hydride region after evacuation at 550 °C and H2 adsorption at 500 °C.
After H2 treatment at 500 °C, Gaussian fittings of the intensity-normalized Ga–H bands resolve three bands at ca. 2009, 1974 and 1931 cm−1 for Ga2O3(200)–H2, at ca. 2017, 1984 and 1939 cm−1 for Ga2O3(250)–H2; but only two bands at ca. 2018 and 1985 cm−1 for Ga2O3(300)–H2. While the fitted area distributions for each band are similar for Ga2O3(200)–H2 and Ga2O3(250)–H2, the respective frequencies of the bands are higher for Ga2O3(250)–H2. For Ga2O3(300)–H2, the two higher frequency bands appear at similar wavenumbers as in Ga2O3(250)–H2, while the band at ca. 1939 cm−1 is not present. Note that a desorption step at 550 °C for 2 h led to a complete disappearance of the hydride bands and restored the OH signatures of the initial dehydroxylated materials.
The high and low frequency Ga–H bands centered at ca. 2020 and 1980 cm−1 have been attributed, respectively, to GaIV–H and GaVI–H sites; a band at a higher vibration frequency is associated with a stronger Ga–H bond. [39], [44], [45] Therefore, the bands located at ca. 1939 and 1931 cm−1 in Ga2O3(250)–H2 and Ga2O3(200)–H2 respectively suggest the presence of weaker Ga–H moieties in these two materials while they are absent in Ga2O3(300)–H2.
3.9. DFT modelling
Using DFT models of dehydroxylated β-Ga2O3 surfaces described by us previously, [7] we have evaluated if a more detailed assignment of Ga–H bands can be made. Ga hydrides were simulated as GaV−H and GaIII−H sites, both isolated and interacting with a vicinal OH group. In addition, the effect of the presence of Vo surface sites on the vibration frequency was explored. The structural models along with the respective hydrogen binding energies and Ga−H bond vibrations obtained from our DFT calculations are displayed in Figure S15. Results show that the presence of a vicinal Vo site induces a decrease in the Ga–H stretching vibration frequency, that is, GaV–H sites feature higher stretching frequencies than GaIII–H sites. In the vicinity of hydroxyl groups, both GaV–H and GaIII–H frequencies decrease. Similarly to the previous DFT studies of Ga hydrides on β-Ga2O3, [46] we observe a linear correlation between Ga–H bond distances and FTIR wavenumbers, that is, shorter Ga–H bond distances correspond to higher wavenumbers (Figure S16).
3.10. 15N DNP SENS
The distribution of surface acid sites in the prepared NPs was studied by 15N DNP SENS using 15N-labelled pyridine (Py) as the probe molecule. [47], [48] After the dehydroxylation of calcined and H2-treated gallia NPs at 500 °C under ca. 10–5 mbar for 2 h, the materials were contacted with Py vapor at room temperature, followed by desorption at 100 °C for 15 min (ca. 10–5 mbar). The materials obtained were stored in a glovebox and handled without any contact to air. Py bound to strong, medium and weak Ga LAS resonates at ca. 235–240, 255–265 and 275–285 ppm, respectively (the chemical shift of bound Py depends on the desorption temperature, i.e. on the surface coverage of Py). [49], [50] However, peaks due to Py on weak LAS and weak BAS overlap (ca. 280–285 ppm). Ga2O3(200) and Ga2O3(250) feature shoulders at ca. 277 ppm (7%) and 283 ppm (4%) that are assigned to Py bound to weak LAS (Fig. 3). [7] Ga2O3(300) contains no weak LAS. According to the fits, the fraction of Py bound to medium LAS comprises 57, 72 and 70% in Ga2O3(200), Ga2O3(250) and Ga2O3(300), respectively while Py bound to strong LAS comprises 36, 24 and 30% in Ga2O3(200), Ga2O3(250) and Ga2O3(300), respectively. Upon H2 treatment, the peak due to Py bound to weak LAS increases strongly in Ga2O3(200)–H2, i.e. to 27%, but only modestly in Ga2O3(250)–H2, i.e. to 6%. On the other hand, H2 treatment of Ga2O3(300), does not lead to the formation of weak LAS in Ga2O3(300)–H2. Furthermore, the reductive treatment does not seem to affect the fraction of Py bound to medium LAS in Ga2O3(200) and Ga2O3(250), i.e. the fitted intensity of Py on medium LAS remains at ca. 55 and 70% in, respectively, Ga2O3(200)–H2 and Ga2O3(250)–H2, but the fraction of Py bound to medium LAS decreases to 43% in Ga2O3(300)–H2. In addition, the fraction of Py bound to strong LAS decreases strongly in Ga2O3(200)–H2, i.e. to 18%, is unaffected in Ga2O3(250)–H2 (24%) and increases strongly in Ga2O3(300)–H2, to 57%.

3.11. Catalytic Performance
Catalytic tests for PDH have been performed at 550 °C and GC data have been collected between 4 and 104 min of time on stream (TOS) (Fig. 4A, Table S4). Among the calcined catalysts, Ga2O3(200) and Ga2O3(250) show the highest initial surface area-normalized (areal) activity, followed by Ga2O3(300) (after 4 min TOS, the activity is 139, 138 and 112 μmol C3H6 m–2 h−1 for Ga2O3(200) Ga2O3(250) and Ga2O3(300), respectively), with similar initial propane conversions (4 min TOS) within ca. 30–33% (Table S4). After 104 min TOS the surface area-normalized catalytic activity has declined by ca. 3.9, 2.9 and 3.3 times for Ga2O3(200), Ga2O3(250) and Ga2O3(300), respectively. The H2-treated catalysts have been prepared in situ prior to the catalytic test (500 °C, 2 h, 40 mL min−1) followed by a 15 min purge with N2 (40 mL min−1) to remove chemisorbed H2 from the surface. The initial areal activity of Ga2O3(200)–H2, Ga2O3(250)–H2 and Ga2O3(300)–H2 is higher than that of the respective calcined catalysts by, respectively, 39, 23 and 38%. Ga2O3(200)–H2 is the most active catalyst, yielding 193 and 56 μmol C3H6 m–2 h−1 after 4 min and 104 min TOS, respectively, followed by Ga2O3(250)–H2 (170 and 67 μmol C3H6 m–2 h−1 after 4 min and 104 min TOS, respectively) and Ga2O3(300)–H2 (155 and 68 μmol C3H6 m–2 h−1 after 4 min and 104 min TOS, respectively). Ga2O3(200)–H2 deactivates the fastest, losing 71% of its initial activity after 104 min TOS, while Ga2O3(250)–H2 and Ga2O3(300)–H2 show similar deactivation rates, i.e. a loss of 61% and 56% over 104 min TOS, respectively. Initial propane conversions for these catalysts are ca. 27–30% (Table S4).

The initial propene selectivities are high and very similar among all of the six tested catalysts, i.e. in the range of 87–90% (Fig. 4B, Table S4). The decrease in propene selectivity with TOS is most pronounced for Ga2O3(200), dropping from 88% after 4 min to 65% after 104 min. For comparison after 104 min TOS, the propene selectivities of Ga2O3(250) and Ga2O3(300) decline from 88% to 75% and from 90% to 77%, respectively. After 104 min TOS, the propene selectivities of Ga2O3(250)–H2 and Ga2O3(300)–H2 are 74% and 78%, that is, similar to the values of the respective calcined catalysts. After 104 min TOF, we observe only for Ga2O3(200)–H2 a higher selectivity (71%) relative to its calcined reference Ga2O3(200) (65%).
Turning now to the side reactions, the cracking rates to methane and ethene (Fig. 4C) are highest for Ga2O3(200) (19.8 and 21.8 μmol C1 + C2= m−2 h−1 after 4 min and 104 min TOS respectively), followed by Ga2O3(250) (18.4 and 15.3 μmol C1 + C2= m−2 h−1 after 4 min and 104 min TOS respectively) and Ga2O3(300) (11.3 and 9.5 μmol C1 + C2= m−2 h−1 after 4 min and 104 min TOS respectively). For all of the catalysts tested, H2 treatment leads to an increase in the cracking rates, giving 27.4 and 22.8 μmol C1 + C2= m−2 h−1 at 4 min and 104 min TOS for Ga2O3(200)–H2, 24.3 and 23.4 μmol C1 + C2= m−2 h−1 at 4 min and 104 min TOS for Ga2O3(250)–H2 and 18.3 and 19.5 μmol C1 + C2= m−2 h−1 at 4 min and 104 min TOS for Ga2O3(300)–H2, respectively.
4. Discussion
In this work, we aimed to understand the effect of H2 treatment on the local, periodic and defect structure, surface properties and catalytic PDH performance of three gallia catalysts that contain different ratios of γ-Ga2O3 and β-Ga2O3 polymorphs. Our recent DFT calculations using a structural model of β-Ga2O3 showed that Ga atoms in tetrahedral surface terminations and located next to Vo sites (i.e., GaIII sites) feature weak LAS properties that likely drive PDH activity. [7] In light of these findings, the objectives of the present work were to understand how H2 treatment modifies the local and periodic structure and the surface properties of Ga2O3 catalysts (LAS site distribution and strength), as well as how such changes at surface sites influence the catalysts’ PDH activity.
Colloidal solutions of gallia NPs were prepared by varying the synthesis temperature and reaction time (200, 250 and 300 °C for 7, 12 and 16 h, respectively), yielding suspensions of ligand-capped γ-Ga2O3 nanoparticles. Calcination at 600 °C gave Ga2O3 NPs that contained different ratios of γ/β polymorphs; according to PDF analysis, the atomic fractions of β-Ga2O3 in Ga2O3(200), Ga2O3(250), and Ga2O3(300) were ca. 40%, 30% and 20% respectively.
H2-treated Ga2O3 NPs were prepared by flowing hydrogen through a bed of calcined Ga2O3 NPs at 500 °C for 2 h. The H2-treated materials were exposed to air after cooling down to room temperature. H2 treatment did not lead to significant changes in the average (bulk) structure according to XRD and PDF analyses, yet it reduced the specific surface areas (by 26–36%) relative to the respective calcined materials (Table S5). The local structure of the Ga2O3 NPs was affected by H2 treatment to various extents, as shown by the EXAFS analysis. We observed a decrease in the CN of the Ga–O and Ga–Ga shells of all H2-treated catalysts, suggesting a more disordered local environment. After H2 treatment, the lowest CN for the Ga–Ga shell were found in Ga2O3(300)–H2, indicating a higher degree of local disorder. It is possible that, due to a higher degree of mobility in the γ-rich nonstoichiometric spinel lattice, the gallium vacancies and the surface oxygen vacancies formed during H2 treatment are directly reoccupied by atoms migrating from the core of the particle, thus leading to the formation of cationic vacancies and Vo sites in the bulk of the gallia nanoparticles. [51], [52], [53] In this context, previous H2-TPR experiments in the literature had compared reducibility of unsupported α-, β-, γ- phases of Ga2O3 and found that while α-Ga2O3 and β-Ga2O3 lack reduction peaks, γ-Ga2O3 features a clear reduction peak centered at 344 °C, probably due to the formation of Vo sites. [54] Since the surface reduction of β-Ga2O3 forms Vo sites already above 277 °C, [55] it is likely that the observed higher reducibility of γ-Ga2O3 is linked to the formation of bulk Vo sites. Such an explanation is consistent with HAADF-STEM imaging that shows an increased degree of disorder in the sub-surface regions in Ga2O3(300)–H2 relative to Ga2O3(300). Yet the two outermost surface layers are highly ordered in both materials, in particular for Ga2O3(300)–H2. An additional piece of evidence for the increased local disorder in the bulk of Ga2O3(300)–H2 is provided by EELS that shows a broadening of the O K-edge peaks while the presence of a pre-edge feature suggested the formation of new energy states (Vo) in the band gap of this material. Since γ-Ga2O3 contains a high density of structural defects, [56] it is likely that the migration of atoms (Ga, O) is favored in Ga2O3(300) relative to Ga2O3(200), which contains a larger fraction of the β-Ga2O3 phase.
The formation of Vo sites upon H2 treatment is consistent with the UV–Vis results that revealed lower band gap energies for the H2 treated materials (measured after exposure to atmospheric air), i.e. the band gap energies reduce from 4.1 to 4.3 eV in the calcined materials to 3.4–3.9 eV after H2 treatment.
FTIR experiments reveal a sharp and intense Ga–OH band at ca. 3727 cm−1 in Ga2O3(300) and, with a lower intensity, in Ga2O3(250). The band at 3727 cm−1 is very weak in Ga2O3(200). Thus, for the series of materials studied here the intensity of the hydroxyl band at 3727 cm−1 correlates directly with the fraction of the γ-Ga2O3 phase present in the Ga2O3 NPs. Hydroxyl bands of similar shape and position have been observed in defective spinels (such as γ-Al2O3 or γ-Ga2O3). Previous works have associated hydroxyl bands at such high wavenumbers with crystallographic cation defect sites while broader bands at lower wavenumbers have been related to Ga–OH sites on terraces. [41], [43].
Surface hydrides form three Ga–H bands in Ga2O3(200)–H2 and Ga2O3(250)–H2, however, the lower frequency band (at ca. 1931–1939 cm−1 due to weaker Ga–H bonds) is missing in Ga2O3(300)–H2. Our DFT calculations on model dehydroxylated β-Ga2O3 surfaces did not allow for an unequivocal assignment of the Ga geometry for each of these Ga–H sites. Nonetheless, GaV−H sites show higher vibrational frequencies than GaIII−H sites. That being said, there is a correlation between the higher relative abundance of the low-frequency Ga hydride bands in two of the studied Ga2O3-H2 materials with the higher relative abundance of weak LAS, the higher relative fraction of β-Ga2O3 and the higher catalytic activity displayed by these materials, which suggests that the low-frequency Ga–H band at ca. 1931–1939 cm−1 may be assigned to GaIII−H sites. In other words, weak LAS form the low-frequency Ga hydride bands associated with weaker Ga–H bonds and such sites are likely connected to faster site regeneration due to easier H2 desorption. However, other studies have suggested that the presence of Vo leads to strongly bonded hydrides, presumably on Gacus sites. [55]
15N DNP SENS results reveal differences between the relative fractions of weak, mild and strong LAS in the studied catalysts. Among the calcined materials, weak LAS are most abundant in Ga2O3(200), less abundant (but detectable) in Ga2O3(250) and lacking in Ga2O3(300). This trend parallels the relative amount of the β-Ga2O3 phase in those materials; that is, predominantly γ-phase Ga2O3(300) contains no weak LAS. In our recent work, we have associated weak LAS in β-Ga2O3 with tricoordinated Ga sites (GaIII), i.e. Ga atoms in a tetrahedral position located next to a Vo site. [7] In this context, it is interesting to note that despite the presence of abundant Vo sites, the surface of Ga2O3(300)–H2 lacks GaIII sites since Ga2O3(300)–H2 contains no weak LAS, which is in agreement with the absence of low-frequency Ga–H moieties in the FTIR spectrum (vide supra). Moreover, while we observe a strong increase of the number of weak LAS after H2 treatment in Ga2O3(200)–H2 (nearly by a factor of 4, up to 27%), explained by the formation of surface Vo sites in the β-Ga2O3 phase that is present in Ga2O3(200)–H2, the opposite effect is observed in Ga2O3(300)–H2, for which the relative fraction of strong LAS nearly doubles relative to Ga2O3(300), reaching 57%, while no weak LAS were detected. The higher density of strong LAS in the surface of Ga2O3(300)–H2 can be related to the increased occupancy of GaVI positions in the surface layers relative to Ga2O3(300), as evidenced by HAADF-STEM. The presence of Ga in octahedral surface termination positions has been linked previously to strong LAS. [7], [8].
Interestingly, while the fitting of the PDF data shows atomic percentages of β-Ga2O3 of ca. 40%, 30% and 20% for Ga2O3(200), Ga2O3(250) and Ga2O3(300), respectively, results of 15N DNP SENS show the lack of weak LAS, typical of β-Ga2O3, on the surface of Ga2O3(300). This result may be interpreted as an indication that the core of Ga2O3(300) has an atomic structure resembling β-Ga2O3 while the shell (surface) retains the structure of γ-Ga2O3.
Finally, we relate the evolution of LAS during H2 treatment to changes in the catalytic activity in PDH. The increase of the initial activity of materials that contain the highest fraction of β-Ga2O3 upon hydrogen treatment, i.e. Ga2O3(200)–H2 and, to a lesser extent, Ga2O3(250)–H2, can be explained by an increase in the relative density of weak LAS, especially in Ga2O3(200)–H2 that also features a decreased fraction of strong LAS, which may explain the more stable propene selectivity of the H2 treated NPs. γ-Rich Ga2O3(300) also increases its initial activity after H2 treatment, despite the fact that Ga2O3(300)–H2 lacks weak LAS and features an increased fraction of less active and more quickly deactivating strong LAS. A possible explanation for this result is the higher density of surface Ga sites in Ga2O3(300)–H2 relative to Ga2O3(300), i.e. surface reconstruction as a result of H2 treatment takes place in Ga2O3(300)–H2 and this disorders the core of Ga2O3(300)–H2 (decreasing coordination numbers of Ga–O and Ga–Ga coordination shells) and densifies the two outer layers (higher density of Ga sites in HAADF STEM line intensity profiles). Lastly, the more defective surfaces in Ga2O3(200) and Ga2O3(250), either calcined or H2-treated, produce higher amounts of cracking products relative to the less defective surfaces in Ga2O3(300) and Ga2O3(300)–H2.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, we report that the material with the highest fraction of β-Ga2O3 is more active in PDH than the γ-rich Ga2O3 catalyst due to the higher proportion of weak LAS in β-Ga2O3; our results show that γ-Ga2O3 lacks these sites. Such weak LAS are likely Gacus (i.e. GaIII) sites. H2 treatment of catalysts at 500 °C creates additional Vo sites in both γ-Ga2O3 and β-Ga2O3. The surface of β-rich Ga2O3 can accommodate Vo sites, and this creates more Gacus, which in turn increases both the fraction of weak LAS and PDH activity. In contrast, no weak LAS are generated when treating the γ–rich Ga2O3 in H2, despite the presence of abundant Vo sites in the bulk of the H2 treated material. However, as we observe a doubling of the fraction of strong LAS (due to an increased relative amount of surface Ga sites in octahedral surface termination positions) and an increased density of Ga sites in the two outermost layers in γ-rich Ga2O3, it is likely that a surface reconstruction has occurred during the H2 treatment of this material. Therefore, the higher activity in γ-rich Ga2O3 after H2 treatment is explained by an increased density of surface Ga sites.
