<English version answer>

1. The article does not evaluate Cr2O3 or Pt-Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It solely focuses on studying Ga2O3 catalysts.

2. The article investigates how tuning oxidation states and oxygen mobility in Ga2O3 affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that hydrogen treatment generates oxygen vacancies in Ga2O3, increasing weak Lewis acid sites that are active for propane dehydrogenation. 

3. The article proposes that weak Lewis acid sites corresponding to under-coordinated gallium atoms near oxygen vacancies are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over Ga2O3 catalysts.

4. The article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects, as it studies unsupported Ga2O3 nanoparticles.

5. The article does not evaluate supported mono-metallic Pt, Pd or Ir catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

6. The article does not investigate properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions for supported metal catalysts, as it focuses solely on Ga2O3.

7. The article does not propose mechanistic pathways for supported metal catalysts, as it studies only Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation.

<Chinese version answer>

1. 该文献没有评估Cr2O3或Pt-Sn作为丙烷脱氢的催化剂。它仅专注于研究Ga2O3催化剂。

2. 该文献研究了调节Ga2O3的氧化态和氧的迁移性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它显示氢处理产生氧空位,增加弱路易酸位,这些位点对丙烷脱氢活性好。

3. 该文献提出氧空位附近的低配位钆原子对应的弱路易酸位是Ga2O3催化剂上丙烷脱氢的活性位点。

4. 该文献没有探究金属-载体界面效应,因为它研究的是未载载的Ga2O3纳米粒子。

5. 该文献没有评估Pt、Pd或Ir等载体金属催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。 

6. 该文献没有研究载体金属催化剂的粒子大小、形状和载体相互作用等性质,因为它仅关注Ga2O3。

7. 该文献没有为载体金属催化剂提出反应机理,因为它仅研究Ga2O3的丙烷脱氢反应。
