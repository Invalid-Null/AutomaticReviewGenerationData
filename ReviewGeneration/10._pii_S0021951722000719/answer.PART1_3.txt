[1] "Three γ/β-Ga2O3 nanoparticle catalysts that differ in the relative ratio of γ-Ga2O3 to β-Ga2O3 were prepared to evaluate the effect of H2 treatment (500 C, 2 h) on the coordination environment of bulk and surface Ga sites, Lewis acidity and catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation (PDH)." 

[2] "The atomic fractions of β-Ga2O3 in Ga2O3(200), Ga2O3(250), and Ga2O3(300) were ca. 40%, 30% and 20% respectively."

[3] "An additional piece of evidence for the increased local disorder in the bulk of Ga2O3(300)H2 is provided by EELS that shows a broadening of the O K-edge peaks while the presence of a pre-edge feature suggested the formation of new energy states (Vo) in the band gap of this material."

[4] "While the fitting of the PDF data shows atomic percentages of β-Ga2O3 of ca. 40%, 30% and 20% for Ga2O3(200), Ga2O3(250) and Ga2O3(300), respectively, results of 15N DNP SENS show the lack of weak LAS, typical of β-Ga2O3, on the surface of Ga2O3(300)."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of Ga2O3 nanoparticles affects propane dehydrogenation performance. The article prepared Ga2O3 nanoparticles with different ratios of γ-Ga2O3 and β-Ga2O3 phases and evaluated the effect of H2 treatment on their structure and catalytic activity. It showed the atomic fractions of β-Ga2O3 were 40%, 30% and 20% for Ga2O3(200), Ga2O3(250) and Ga2O3(300) respectively. EELS data suggested H2 treatment increased disorder and oxygen vacancies in γ-rich Ga2O3(300)H2. Although Ga2O3(300) contained 20% β-Ga2O3 by PDF analysis, 15N DNP SENS showed it lacked weak Lewis acid sites typical of β-Ga2O3 on the surface.

答:是的,该文探究了调控Ga2O3纳米粒子的氧化态、氧迁移和酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。该文制备了不同γ-Ga2O3与β-Ga2O3相比例的Ga2O3纳米粒子,并评估了H2处理对其结构和催化活性的影响。结果显示,Ga2O3(200)、Ga2O3(250)和Ga2O3(300)中的β-Ga2O3原子分数分别为40%、30%和20%。EELS数据表明,H2处理增加了γ相丰富的Ga2O3(300)H2的无序性和氧空位。尽管根据PDF分析,Ga2O3(300)含有20%的β-Ga2O3,但15N DNP SENS结果显示其表面缺乏β-Ga2O3典型的弱路易斯酸中心。
