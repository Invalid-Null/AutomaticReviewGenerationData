1. The article does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3 or Pt-Sn for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses solely on evaluating gallium oxide (Ga2O3) nanoparticles as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

[1] "Three γ/β-Ga2O3 nanoparticle catalysts that differ in the relative ratio of γ-Ga2O3 to β-Ga2O3 were prepared to evaluate the effect of H2 treatment (500 C, 2 h) on the coordination environment of bulk and surface Ga sites, Lewis acidity and catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."

[2] "According to the fits, the fraction of Py bound to medium LAS comprises 57, 72 and 70% in Ga2O3(200), Ga2O3(250) and Ga2O3(300), respectively while Py bound to strong LAS comprises 36, 24 and 30% in Ga2O3(200), Ga2O3(250) and Ga2O3(300), respectively." 

[3] "Upon H2 treatment, the peak due to Py bound to weak LAS increases strongly in Ga2O3(200)H2, i.e. to 27%, but only modestly in Ga2O3(250)H2, i.e. to 6%."

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states and acid-base properties of gallium oxide nanoparticles affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It prepares Ga2O3 nanoparticles with different ratios of γ-Ga2O3 and β-Ga2O3 phases and treats them with H2 to modify oxidation states. It uses pyridine adsorption to show the nanoparticles have different fractions of weak, medium and strong Lewis acid sites depending on composition and H2 treatment. H2 treatment increases weak acid sites in β-rich catalysts but not in γ-rich ones.

2. 是的,该文献研究了调谐氧化态和酸碱性如何影响氧化镓纳米颗粒的丙烷脱氢性能。它制备了不同比例的γ-Ga2O3和β-Ga2O3相的Ga2O3纳米颗粒,并用H2处理来调节氧化态。它使用吡啶吸附显示纳米颗粒根据组成和H2处理具有不同强度的刘易斯酸中心。H2处理增加β相含量高的催化剂中的弱酸中心,但对γ相含量高的没有这种效果。

[1] "Our recent DFT calculations using a structural model of β-Ga2O3 showed that Ga atoms in tetrahedral surface terminations and located next to Vo sites (i.e., GaIII sites) feature weak LAS properties that likely drive PDH activity."

[2] "Such weak LAS are likely Gacus (i.e. GaIII) sites."

[3] "The surface of β-rich Ga2O3 can accommodate Vo sites, and this creates more Gacus, which in turn increases both the fraction of weak LAS and PDH activity."

3. Yes, the article proposes that weak Lewis acid sites associated with under-coordinated gallium atoms (GaIII) adjacent to oxygen vacancies are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation over gallium oxide. DFT calculations suggest these GaIII sites have the ideal acidity for activating propane. The creation of oxygen vacancies on β-Ga2O3 surfaces generates more GaIII sites, increasing weak acidity and dehydrogenation activity.

3. 是的,该文献提出相邻氧空位的下配位镓原子(GaIII)相关的弱刘易斯酸中心是氧化镓上丙烷脱氢的活性中心。 DFT计算表明这些GaIII位点具有激活丙烷的理想酸度。 在β-Ga2O3表面上生成更多氧空位可以产生更多GaIII位点,增加弱酸性和脱氢活性。
