Ga2O22+ Stabilized by Paired Framework Al Atoms in MFI: A Highly Reactive Site in Nonoxidative Propane Dehydrogenation
Abstract
Determination of the structure of Ga-containing catalytic sites in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction on Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been a long-standing challenge for understanding Ga-based catalysts but has been hampered by the complexity of the system. We employed quantitative pulse titration reactions to differentiate two types of Ga species based on their distinct redox properties: divalent Ga species balancing paired framework Al atoms and isolated Ga+ sites. While isolated Ga+ is redox-active, the divalent Ga species cannot be reduced or oxidized at reaction temperature (550 C) by H2 or O2, respectively. Together with in situ infrared spectroscopic evidence, the highly active divalent Ga species is identified to be Ga2O22+. The PDH activity of Ga2O22+ is shown to be at least a factor of 18 higher than that of isolated Ga+, suggesting that increasing the density of the former could be an effective strategy in enhancing the catalytic performance. Interestingly, only 30% of Al pair sites observed through the Co2+ exchange protocol are able to stabilize Ga2O22+, that is, the latter has a more stringent requirement for the proximity between the two adjacent framework Al atoms, thus providing an additional method to probe the Al distribution in zeolites.

On-demand production of ethylene and propylene via the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes is an effective strategy in the making up for the supplydemand gap of alkenes as shale gas share as a hydrocarbon feedstock continues to rise. (17) Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes is thermodynamically favorable; however, maintaining selectivity control at high conversions remains challenging. (8) Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, though limited by thermodynamics, has much potential for catalyst improvement as current commercial processes operate substantially below equilibrium conversions. (8) Currently, the two operating commercial nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) processes use PtSn based (Oleflex) and CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) catalysts, respectively. (1,9) The high cost and environmental risks of these commercial catalysts have incentivized the search for other PDH catalysts, among which Ga/H-ZSM-5 is a prominent candidate. (1013)
Although the optimal alkene yield on Ga/H-ZSM-5 is on par with PtSn and CrOx-based catalysts, the space velocity at which the optimal alkene yield can be reached is significantly lower, suggesting lower intrinsic dehydrogenation rates. (1) We recently determined the intrinsic PDH activities of two types of Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (14) and found that Ga species balancing negative framework charges associated with paired framework Al atoms exhibit higher reaction rates than isolated Ga+ sites by a factor of 15 in terms of turnover frequency (TOF). (14) In addition, the PDH activation energy of the former is 30 kJ/mol lower than the latter. (14) This is in line with recent literature showing that the distribution of framework Al atoms in H-ZSM-5 substantially impacts PDH rates. (10,11) The highly active Ga species only account for a small fraction of the Ga species capable of exchanging with protons of H-ZSM-5, due to the limited density of paired framework Al sites. (1014) This insight suggests that the synthesis of H-ZSM-5 with enriched paired framework Al atoms could be a fruitful strategy in enhancing the PDH activity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.
Despite the mounting evidence supporting the correlation between paired framework Al sites density and enhanced PDH activity, the identity of the highly active Ga species remains controversial. Phadke et al. (11) claimed that [GaH]2+ species anchored by Al pair sites are the active centers for the PDH, while Schreiber et al. (10) believed that the Ga+H+ pair is more reactive than isolated Ga+ sites. Little experimental evidence has been gathered regarding the composition and structure of the most active Ga species, though several structures have been proposed via computational studies. (10,11,15) A common feature of the two proposed structures, i.e., [GaH]2+ and Ga+H+ pair, is that they should be susceptible to oxidation. Our recent report showed, however, that the Ga species balancing Al pairs remained unreacted upon exposure to water vapor at 150 C, while isolated Ga+ was readily oxidized as corroborated using in situ transmission Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. (16) Thus, the active Ga species is unlikely to be at an oxidation state of +1. Further, recent publications, including ours, typically used the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite as a proxy of the paired framework Al sites density to correlate with reaction rates. (14,1719) Since Al pair density is not necessarily a monotonic function of the Si/Al ratio of zeolites, (20,21) a more rigorous correlation needs to be established to guide catalyst design.
Here, we employed quantitative in situ FTIR spectroscopy and pulse titration reactions to determine the identity of the highly active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5. The density of the highly active Ga species was found to decrease as paired framework Al sites are increasingly occupied by exchanged Co2+, indicating that the associated Ga species is a divalent cation. Pulse titration reactions confirm that these Ga species are not oxidized by O2 at 550 C, suggesting that Ga is in an oxidation state of +3. Aided by additional spectroscopic evidence, the highly active Ga species is proposed to be in the form of Ga2O22+. Only 30% of paired framework Al sites capable of balancing Co2+ are able to stabilize Ga2O22+, that is, the latter has a more exact requirement of the distance between the two adjacent Al atoms. Therefore, Ga2O22+ density, as Co2+, could be employed to provide a novel metric of framework Al distribution in zeolites.

Determining the Composition of Intraporous Ga Species
Pulse reactions with 10 vol % O2 (with balancing N2) were employed to determine the composition of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples. Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts with varying Si/Al and Ga/Al ratios were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation followed by calcination; hereon, these are referred to as Ga/H-ZSM-5 (X, Y) with X and Y representing the Si/Al ratio and the Ga/Al ratio, respectively. Their composition and chemical properties are summarized in Tables S1 and S2. (16) The schematic of the pulse reactor setup (Figure S1) is included in the Supporting Information. As-synthesized Ga/H-ZSM-5 cannot be fully reduced by 10 vol % H2 pulses at 550 C (Figure S2), most likely due to the low concentration of H2 in the H2 pulses. Consequently, the amount of water produced during the reduction of as-synthesized Ga/H-ZSM-5 was determined by monitoring the 18 amu signal with an online mass spectrometer (MS) during reduction of the sample in flowing H2 (10 vol %) at 550 C (Figure 1a). This is the typical activation condition employed prior to the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction. (14) Pulses containing 10 vol % O2 were then introduced to the reduced catalyst until no O2 consumption was observed, signaling its complete reoxidation. One example MS spectrum of the O2 pulse reaction is shown in Figure 1a, in which the first eight pulses of O2 are completely consumed by reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 1.7). The molar ratio between water formed in the reduction and oxygen consumed in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) samples (Y = 01.7) is determined to be close to 1.5 (1.6  0.1, in Figures 1b, S3, and S4), confirming that Ga2O3 in as-synthesized samples is reduced to Ga+ during this process, as reported by Lercher and co-workers. (10) As expected, the amounts of water formed and O2 consumed increase monotonically with the Ga loading at Ga/Al ratios below 0.7 (Figure 1b). However, increasing the Ga/Al ratio beyond 0.7 does not affect the redox capacity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), indicating that a growing fraction of Ga cannot be reduced at high Ga loadings. Importantly, at the Ga/Al ratio of 0.042, no appreciable amount of water and oxygen were formed and consumed, respectively. Brnsted acid site (BAS) densities on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) were determined with quantitative FTIR spectroscopy using pyridine as the probe molecule. The ratio of the consumed oxygen (on a per-atom basis) determined in the pulse experiments vs the BAS density (referred to as the O/BAS ratio), as well as the fraction of BAS replaced by Ga species during reduction, (16) in the reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) is plotted against the Ga/BAS ratio (molar ratio between Ga and BAS in the parent H-ZSM-5) in Figure 1c. At the Ga/BAS ratio of 0.066 (corresponding to the Ga/Al ratio of 0.042, because 62% of framework Al atoms are charge-balanced by a proton), (16) there is clear consumption of BAS via the ion exchange between Ga+ with H+ without the accompanying O consumption (Figure 1c, inset). This suggests that this type of exchanged Ga species cannot be reduced by H2 at 550 C, and thus the lack of reoxidation. In this set of samples, Ga species are preferentially exchanged into the redox-inactive configuration.
Figure 1
Figure 1. (a) H2, H2O, and O2 MS signals vs time during the reduction and reoxidation of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 1.7). The reduction was conducted in a 10 vol % H2 flow at 550 C, and the reoxidation was conducted by introducing pulses containing 10 vol % O2 to the catalyst bed at 550 C. This is continued until no further O2 consumption was observed. (b) Relationship of the amount of H2O formed and O atoms consumed on Ga/H-ZSM-5(15, Y) catalysts was investigated (the corresponding Ga/Al ratio is shown in parentheses). (c) O/BAS ratio and the fraction of BAS replaced by Ga during reduction as a function of the Ga/BAS ratio of catalysts (inset replots the data in the low Ga/BAS range of Figure 1c). The relationship of the exchanged Ga/BAS vs Ga/BAS was determined in reference (16).
Oxygen consumption results, together with the fraction of BAS displaced by the Ga site, can be used to determine the density of the divalent Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), which is referred to as GaxOy2+ before its composition is proposed later in this work. The difference between the O/BAS ratio and the fraction of BAS displaced, i.e., left and right axes of Figure 1c, respectively, is the fraction Ga species in the form of GaxOy2+. This is because the GaxOy2+ species consumes BAS in its formation but does not consume O2 in titration experiments. The difference between the O/BAS ratio and the fraction of BAS displaced is stable at 10% (Figure 1c) at Ga/BAS ratios above 0.12 (Ga/Al = 0.075), suggesting that 10% framework Al atoms are in the paired configuration capable of stabilizing the irreducible Ga species. The fraction exchanged Ga present in the form of GaxOy2+ increases with the decrease of Ga/BAS, and this fraction is 100% on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042) (Figure 1b,c). This sample has a Ga/BAS of 0.066, so at least 6.6% of BAS are balancing paired framework Al sites, according to the relationship that one Ga atom replaces one BAS. (16) It follows that a majority (66%) of sites capable of stabilizing divalent cations are occupied by GaxOy2+ on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042) with 10% of BAS are present in the proximity of one another. This is consistent with the observation that TOFGa drops precipitously when the Ga/Al increases above 0.042 (14) because higher loadings of Ga would introduce a type of Ga species, i.e., isolated Ga+, with much a lower intrinsic PDH activity than that of divalent Ga species (by a factor of 15). (14) Higher maximum O/BAS values were observed on Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples with Si/Al ratios of 28 and 39, being 0.81 and 0.82, respectively. Comparing with the maximum fractions of BAS displaced by Ga on these two samples (0.87 and 0.80, respectively), (16) we estimate that 6% BAS are balancing paired framework Al sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (28) and the density of paired framework Al sites on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39) is below the detection limit. These results are reasonable as the fraction of paired framework Al sites generally varies inversely with the Al density in zeolites. Previous studies reported that some Ga remains on the external surface of zeolite crystals prepared by impregnation after reduction. (16) The fraction of Ga on the external surface in samples with Ga/BAS < 0.5 is minor, as a close to unity ratio of Ga to exchanged BAS is determined. (13,16) Although external Ga species is redox-inactive, (22,23) it does not impact the discussion regarding GaxOy2+, the fraction of which is determined based on exchanged Ga, rather than the total Ga loading. External Ga species are known to be inactive in PDH (14) and thus would not affect the correlation of GaxOy2+ with the PDH performance.
Paired Framework Al Sites Determined by Co2+ Titration
The density of paired framework Al sites on H-ZSM-5 samples was determined by the Co2+ titration method. (20,21,24,25) Co-H-ZSM-5 was prepared by liquid phase ion exchange of NH4-ZSM-5 in Co2+ solutions with an excess of Co2+ to ensure the maximum level of Co exchange was achieved. (20) These samples are denoted as Co-H-ZSM-5 (X, Z), in which X and Z represent the Si/Al and Co/Al ratios, respectively, i.e., Co-H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.23), Co-H-ZSM-5 (28, 0.33), and Co-H-ZSM-5 (39, 0.29). The UVvis band centered at 19000 cm1 of Co exchanged zeolites has been assigned to the dd transition of Co2+ exchanged with Al pair sites, and its integrated peak area has been correlated with the Al pair sites density of the zeolite. (20,26) The intensity of this band decreases with the increase of the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite (Figure 2a), with the band barely discernable on Co-H-ZSM-5 (39, 0.29). Quantitative pyridine FTIR spectroscopy shows that BAS densities on Co-H-ZSM-5 with Si/Al ratios of 15, 28, and 39 are reduced by 35%, 17%, and 5%, respectively (Figure S5). Ratios between the integrated area of the GaHx band in the FTIR (20,26) and Co2+ band in the UVvis spectra on Co-H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.23) and Co-H-ZSM-5 (28, 0.33) are comparable (Figure 2b), revealing a strong correlation between the paired framework Al sites and the ability to stabilize GaHx species, and in turn a shared physical origin.

(b) SCo2+ (peak area of Co2+ normalized by a per gram of catalyst) and SGaHx (maximized GaHx peak area normalized by a per gram of catalyst) between the Si/Al ratio of 15 and 28 with Ga/Al ratios of 0.13 and 0.15, respectively.
Ga Supported on Co-H-ZSM-5
Ga supported on Co-H-ZSM-5 samples with a fixed Si/Al ratio of 15 were prepared to further establish the correlation between the ability to stabilize GaHx species and framework Al pairs. Co-H-ZSM-5 was prepared by exchanging NH4-ZSM-5 with varying concentrations of Co2+ solution, followed by washing, drying, and calcination, (20) which led to Co/Al ratios in the range of 00.23 (Figure S6). Ga supported on Co-H-ZSM-5 samples is denoted as Ga/Co-H-ZSM-5 (X, Y, Z), where X, Y, and Z represent the Si/Al, Ga/Al, and Co/Al ratios, respectively. As the Co/Al ratio increases, infrared bands attributable to GaHx (20302060 cm1) on Ga/Co-H-ZSM-5 upon reduction at 550 C decrease and disappear completely at Co/Al ratios above 0.2 (Figure 3a,b). FTIR spectroscopy confirms that both Co and Ga displace BAS via ion exchange (Figure S5a). UVvis spectra of Co-H-ZSM-5 and the corresponding Ga/Co-H-ZSM-5 are similar, indicating the negligible impact of the added Ga on the Co species in the support (Figure S7). Thus, the negative correlation between the GaHx band intensity and the Co/Al ratio shows that the density of GaHx species depends on the available Al pair sites, i.e., pairs not yet titrated by Co2+.

(a) FTIR spectra of H2-treated Ga/Co-H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.3, Z) with different Co/Al ratios collected at 550 C: (i) Co/Al = 0; (ii) Co/Al = 0.019; (iii) Co/Al = 0.045; (iv) Co/Al = 0.11; (v) Co/Al = 0.22; and (vi) Co/Al = 0.23. (b) Integrated GaHx peak area determined via quantitative FTIR spectroscopy as a function of the Co/Al ratio (The peak area was normalized to the GaHx peak area of Ga/Co-H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.3, 0)).
Investigations of the reduction and subsequent oxidation of Ga/Co-H-ZSM-5 (15, Y, 0.22) with varying Ga/Al ratios corroborate that only isolated Ga+ participates in the redox chemistry. Neither was H2O formed during reduction with 10 vol % H2 nor O2 consumed during the subsequent oxidation in 10 vol % O2 on Co-H-ZSM-5 (15, 0, 0.22) at 550 C (Figures 4a and S8), consistent with reported results (27) showing that Co2+ is incapable of being reduced or oxidized at this temperature. Upon introducing Ga, clear redox chemistry was observed (Figure 4a). A molar ratio between the produced water and the consumed O2 of 1.5 (1.5  0.1) was observed on Ga/Co-H-ZSM-5 (15, Y, 0.22) with varying Ga loadings (Figure 4a), showing that the redox-active species in these samples are the same as Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Figure 1b). In contrast to Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042), Ga/Co-H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.050, 0.22) produces and consumes substantial water and O2, respectively, during the reduction and the subsequent reoxidation steps at a comparable Ga loading (Figure 4a). This indicates that Co2+ in Ga/Co-H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.050, 0.22) prevents intraporous Ga from occupying specific sites to form redox-inactive Ga species, i.e., divalent Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042). This is consistent with Co2+s ability to balance the double negative charges created by paired framework Al sites. This explanation also agrees with the plot of the amount of water formed vs the amount of O2 consumed of Ga/Co-H-ZSM-5 (15, Y, 0.22), which is shifted to the left of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) (Figure 4b, inset). The line correlating water formed vs O2 consumed passes through the origin, indicating the lack of GaxOy2+ on Ga/Co-ZSM-5 (15, 0.050, 0.22).

Identity of the Divalent GaxOy2+ Species
The resistance of GaxOy2+ toward oxidation in O2 at 550 C calls into question many previously hypothesized structures. (10,11,16,28,29) Our previous assignment of Ga+H+ cation pair appears unlikely because Ga(I) species are susceptible to oxidation. For example, we showed that isolated Ga+ species can be easily oxidized by water vapor at 150 C in Ga/H-ZSM-5. (16) The assignments of the infrared bands located at 2037 and 2053 cm1 to [GaH2]+ and [GaH]2+ species, respectively, (28,29) also need to be reassessed. Both bands are inextricably linked to Ga species balancing paired framework Al sites, as they decrease in intensity when paired framework Al sites are increasingly occupied by Co2+ (Figure 3a). [GaH]2+ can be viewed as a divalent cation, like Co2+, which is expected to be located around paired framework Al sites. It is conceptually more difficult to justify the exclusive positioning of [GaH2]+ in the proximity of paired framework Al sites because isolated framework negative charges can balance monovalent cations. Further, [GaH2]+ and [GaH]2+ are expected to react rapidly with O2 at elevated temperatures, as metal hydride species are typically easily oxidized. Thus, only divalent species with Ga in the oxidation state of +3 without hydride should be considered.
Infrared spectra of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.31) treated with a mixture of H2 and D2 suggest that [GaH2]+ is unlikely to be present in the reduced sample. Upon reduction with H2 at 550 C, the FTIR spectrum of the reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 shows a positive and a negative peak at 3735 and 3591 cm1 (Figure S9ai), respectively, which can be attributed to the partial restoration of external silanol groups and consumed BAS upon reduction and Ga exchange with BAS, respectively. (16) Bands centered at 2037 and 2053 cm1, attributed to [GaH2]+ and [GaH]2+, respectively, appear in the presence of H2 (Figure S9ci). Upon switching to D2 (1 atm) at the same temperature, several types of OD stretching bands, including the SiOD (2751 cm1), extra-framework AlOD (2684 cm1), and OD bands associated with the BAS (2647 cm1) appeared via the HD exchange. Both the [GaH2]+ and [GaH]2+ bands were converted to two similarly broad bands at 1467 and 1479 cm1, respectively (Figure S9dii), attributable to [GaD2]+ and [GaD]+ due to the HD exchange. The reintroduction of H2 largely replaced the OD groups and GaDx bands with OH and GaHx bands, respectively (Figure S9iii). Both GaHx and GaDx were observed upon contacting reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 with H2D2 mixtures of varying compositions (Figure 5a,b). As the fraction of D2 increases, more GaHx are converted to GaDx. Importantly, no additional peak attributable to [GaHD]+ in the presence of H2D2 mixtures was observed, which was expected to exhibit a distinct IR feature from those of GaHx and GaDx. We confirmed that both H-ZSM-5 (15) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.31) were able to scramble the H2/D2 mixture at 550 C to produce HD (Figure S10). The chemical equivalence of H2, HD, and D2 dictates that if HD exists, a fraction of [GaH2]+ and [GaD2]+ will be converted to [GaHD]+ (Figure 5c). Thus, the absence of the spectral feature attributable to [GaHD]+ is direct evidence against the presence of this species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5. The analysis above also precludes the existence of any other Ga dihydride species.

We propose that Ga2O22+ is the divalent Ga species balancing paired framework Al sites (referred to as GaxOy2+ in the text above) given that Ga is present in the oxidation state of +3 without any hydride. The only mononuclear Ga species that meet these requirements is [GaOH]2+, which is expected to have an infrared-active OH stretching mode (3660 cm1). (16) However, no band corresponding to such species was observed on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042) upon exposure to O2 (Figure S11). The GaOH band appears on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 39) with Ga/Al ratios from 0.12 to 0.44 (Figure S11). Importantly, the absolute Ga loadings are similar (0.3%) on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, 0.12), thereby ruling out the possibility that the absence of GaOH band on the former is caused by its low density. Ga2nO3n12+ (n = 1, 2, 3, ...) have the desired stoichiometry, i.e., divalent and Ga in the oxidation state of +3. The 1:1 stoichiometry in the Ga/BAS exchange (16) makes Ga2O22+ the only viable choice, as higher n values lead to Ga/BAS exchange ratios above unity. Binuclear metal oxo-species cations have been reported in a number of zeolites, e.g., Fe2O22+, (30,31) Cu2O22+, (32,33) [CoOCo]2+, (27) [Zn-O-Zn]2+. (34,35) Although X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) was repeatedly employed to determine the oxidation state of Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5, (10,12,3638) the low absolute Ga loadings, at which Ga2O22+ is the primary Ga species in the sample, make it difficult to provide definitive information. (12) The Ga loading on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042) is 0.28 wt %, which is at least a factor of 3 lower than those employed in previous studies. (12,3638) In addition, XANES band assignments remain debated on Ga/H-ZSM-5. (36)
Infrared bands at 2037 and 2053 cm1 upon H2 treatment of Ga/H-ZSM-5 are attributed to HGa2O2+···H+ cation pair (Scheme 1) via the heterolytic dissociative adsorption of H2 on Ga2O22+. HGa2O2+···H+ is not a stable species, as its IR band decays quickly under vacuum at 550 C via the reformation of Ga2O22+ and desorption of H2. (16) The two IR bands corresponding to the hydride species can be attributed to two distinct coordinating environments for Ga2O22+ in H-ZSM-5. This hypothesis is supported by the slightly different line shape of the peak observed on Ga/H-MOR samples because of the different coordinating environments caused by different framework topologies.

PDH Activity of Ga2O22+ and Isolated Ga+
The PDH reactivities of Ga2O22+ and isolated Ga+ were determined by pulse reactions with propane. The pulses of 10 vol % C3H8/Ar were introduced to H2 and H2O2 treated Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042) and Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, 0.44), in which only Ga2O22+ and isolated Ga+, respectively, are present. (16) In the reduced form, C3H8 conversion rates were 0.478  0.029 and 0.052  0.004 molC3H8·molGa1·s1 on Ga2O22+ and isolated Ga+, respectively (Figure 6). These values are consistent with TOFGa determined previously in a flow reactor at the steady state (14) (0.597  0.091 and 0.045  0.005 molC3H8·molGa1·s1, respectively). The ratio of the propane conversion rates between Ga2O22+ and isolated Ga+ on a per Ga basis in the pulse reaction is 9.2, lower than that determined in the flow reactor (15); the details are included in the Text S1 in the Supporting Information. This could be attributed to the relatively high conversion (18%) on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042) in the pulse reaction, which is slightly outside the kinetic regime. Since Ga2O22+ is considered as a single active site, on a per active site basis, the propane conversion rate of Ga2O22+ is a factor of 18.4 higher than that of isolated Ga+. Detailed analyses (Supporting Text S1, Tables S4 and S5) by removing contributions of unexchanged BAS to rate and selectivity reveal that while Ga2O22+ and Ga+ show similar C3H6 selectivity (9192%), Ga2O22+ is much more active than Ga+ in propylene production. A similar initial propane conversion rate was observed on H2O2 treated Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042), which was expected given the lack of redox activity of Ga2O22+ (Figures 6 and S12). Surprisingly, H2O2 treated Ga/H-ZSM-5 (39, 0.44) shows a slightly higher initial propane conversion than the reduced sample (Figure 6). Control experiments show that neither H2 nor propane pulses are effective in reducing H2O2 treated Ga/H-ZSM-5 (Figure S13), suggesting that isolated Ga species in its oxidized form, e.g., GaO+, is slightly more active than Ga+ in the PDH. However, these oxidized isolated Ga species are unstable in the PDH atmosphere at the steady state due to the presence of H2 produced in the reaction or catalyze oxidative PDH with GaO+ as the oxidant (Figure S14). PDH activity of oxidized isolated Ga species is largely unknown because they are typically reduced during catalyst activation prior to the PDH. The distinct compositions and redox properties of Ga2O22+ and isolated Ga+ suggest that PDH likely proceeds via different pathways on these two types of sites. It is noted that the intrinsic activities of Ga2O22+ are comparable to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, (1) suggesting that Ga/H-ZSM-5 with dominant Ga2O22+ species could be competitive and cost-effective catalysts for the PDH reaction.

Co2+ vs Ga2O22+ as Titrants of Paired Framework Al Sites
Since both Co2+ and Ga2O22+ are divalent cations capable of balancing paired framework Al sites, it is informative to compare quantitatively their ability in titrating paired framework Al sites. A Co/Al ratio of 0.23 was determined via the Co2+ titration on H-ZSM-5 (15), suggesting that 46% of Al atoms are located sufficiently close to one another to balance a Co2+ cation. This is consistent with previous reports using the same commercial zeolite. (11,26) Pyridine/FTIR spectra show that the BAS density in H-ZSM-5 (15) corresponds to 60% of Al content, (16) leading to an estimated 70% BAS located at paired framework Al sites. However, the BAS density of Co-H-ZSM-5 (15, 0, 0.23) is only 35% lower than that of the parent H-ZSM-5 (Figure S5), hinting that not all Co species in Co-H-ZSM-5 are balancing paired framework Al sites with the assumed Co/Al ratio of 1:2. This is consistent with Iglesia and co-workers finding that Co2+ cations replace 1.11.3 zeolitic protons in H-ZSM-5 with the coexistence of Co2+OCo2+ dimers and Co2+ monomers. (27) In contrast, only 10% of Al atoms are balanced by Ga2O22+ based on results in Figure 1b, indicating that Ga2O22+ can only exist in a subset (30%) of sites capable of coordinating with Co2+. Further increasing Ga loading (Ga/BAS > 1.5) or lengthening the H2 treatment of the sample did not change the O/BAS ratio or the fraction of BAS replaced, suggesting the Ga2O22+ density is not limited by diffusion limitations of Ga species in zeolite pores. Different results from these two methods could be rationalized by the difference in their preparation methods. Co2+ is exchanged into NH4-ZSM-5 in an aqueous solution, where Co2+ is present as bulky hydrated cations. The hydrated Co2+ can be balanced by negative charges in zeolite micropores that are relatively far apart. In contrast, Ga2O22+ is formed via gas-phase diffusion of Ga species in H2 at elevated temperatures (>500 C) without a hydration shell and can only be stabilized by adjacent framework negative charges. Only a minor fraction of framework Al pairs capable of balancing Co2+ are able to stabilize Ga2O22+. In other words, the ability to balance Ga2O22+ requires a closer framework AlAl distance than that for Co2+.
Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
We identified Ga2O22+ as the highly active center on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in the PDH via a combination of pulse titration reactions and in situ FTIR spectroscopy. A H2O/O molar ratio of 1.5 was determined from the amounts of water produced during the reduction of Ga species and O2 consumed during their reoxidation, suggesting that isolated Ga+ sites are redox-active. The ability of the divalent Ga species to stabilize Ga hydride species is demonstrated by the lack of the infrared bands for Ga hydride on Co-H-ZSM-5 support, where all paired framework Al sites are occupied by Co2+. Importantly, divalent Ga species balancing paired framework Al sites are redox-inactive, indicating an oxidation state of +3 for Ga. Together with spectroscopic and reactivity results, we propose that Ga2O22+ is the divalent Ga species balancing the paired framework Al sites and the most active sites in the PDH in Ga/H-ZSM-5. Further, Ga2O22+ as a titrant exhibits a stringent requirement for the proximity of neighboring Al sites in zeolites compared to Co2+ and thus offers an effective method for determining the spatial distribution of Al in zeolites.
