 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature to answer the questions. The literature focuses on characterizing gallium oxide species on zeolites for propane dehydrogenation, but does not evaluate other metal oxide catalysts or supported mono-metallic catalysts. It also does not investigate oxidation states or acid-base properties of metal oxides, propose mechanistic pathways, or explore metal-support effects.

<English version answer>

1. The literature does not evaluate promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation.

2. The literature does not investigate how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance.

3. The literature does not propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the studied metal oxide catalysts.

4. The literature does not explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. 

5. The literature does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir for propane dehydrogenation.

6. The literature does not investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts.

7. The literature does not propose mechanistic reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over the studied supported metal catalysts.
