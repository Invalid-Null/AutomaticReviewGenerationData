[1] Determination of the structure of Ga-containing catalytic sites in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction on Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been a long-standing challenge for understanding Ga-based catalysts but has been hampered by the complexity of the system.

[2] We recently determined the intrinsic PDH activities of two types of Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (14) and found that Ga species balancing negative framework charges associated with paired Al atoms exhibit higher reaction rates than isolated Ga+ sites by a factor of 15 in terms of turnover frequency (TOF).

[3] This insight suggests that the synthesis of H-ZSM-5 with enriched paired framework Al atoms could be a fruitful strategy in enhancing the PDH activity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

2. The article explains that catalysts like Ga/H-ZSM-5 facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing catalytic sites that balance paired framework Al atoms, lowering activation barriers. It also states that Ga species associated with paired Al atoms have 15 times higher turnover frequency than isolated Ga+ sites, suggesting synthesis of H-ZSM-5 with more paired Al could enhance PDH activity.

2.这篇文章解释说,Ga/H-ZSM-5等催化剂通过提供平衡成对的框架Al原子的催化位点来促进丙烷脱氢,降低激活能垒。它还指出,与成对Al原子相关的Ga种与隔离的Ga+位点相比,周转频率高15倍,这表明合成具有更多成对Al的H-ZSM-5可以增强PDH活性。

[1] On-demand production of ethylene and propylene via the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes is an effective strategy in the making up for the supplydemand gap of alkenes as shale gas share as a hydrocarbon feedstock continues to rise. 

[2] Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes is thermodynamically favorable; however, maintaining selectivity control at high conversions remains challenging.

[3] Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, though limited by thermodynamics, has much potential for catalyst improvement as current commercial processes operate substantially below equilibrium conversions.

4. The article discusses that propane dehydrogenation is thermodynamically limited, but nonoxidative PDH has potential for catalyst improvement since current processes operate below equilibrium conversion. It also mentions that oxidative PDH is favorable thermodynamically but maintaining selectivity is challenging.
