[1] "We employed quantitative in situ FTIR spectroscopy and pulse titration reactions to determine the identity of the highly active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts."

[2] "The pulse reactor setup (Figure S1) is included in the Supporting Information."

[3] "As-synthesized Ga/H-ZSM-5 cannot be fully reduced by 10 vol % H2 pulses at 550 C (Figure S2), most likely due to the low concentration of H2 in the H2 pulses." 

[4] "Consequently, the amount of water produced during the reduction of as-synthesized Ga/H-ZSM-5 was determined by monitoring the 18 amu signal with an online mass spectrometer (MS) during reduction of the sample in flowing H2 (10 vol %) at 550 C (Figure 1a)."

[5] "This is the typical activation condition employed prior to the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction."

[6] "One example MS spectrum of the O2 pulse reaction is shown in Figure 1a, in which the first eight pulses of O2 are completely consumed by reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 1.7)."

[7] "The molar ratio between water formed in the reduction and oxygen consumed in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) samples (Y = 01.7) is determined to be close to 1.5 (1.6 ± 0.1, in Figures 1b, S3, and S4), confirming that Ga2O3 in as-synthesized samples is reduced to Ga+ during this process, as reported by Lercher and co-workers."

4. Yes, the article utilizes in situ characterization techniques including FTIR spectroscopy, pulse titration reactions, and mass spectrometry to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it employs quantitative in situ FTIR spectroscopy and pulse titration reactions with H2 and O2 to determine the identity and composition of active Ga species. It also monitors H2O production during catalyst reduction and O2 consumption during reoxidation using online mass spectrometry. These techniques provide insights into the oxidation state changes of Ga species during PDH catalysis.

[1] "Together with in situ infrared spectroscopic evidence, the highly active divalent Ga species is identified to be Ga2O22+."

[2] "The ability of the divalent Ga species to stabilize Ga hydride species is demonstrated by the lack of the infrared bands for Ga hydride on Co-H-ZSM-5 support, where all paired framework Al sites are occupied by Co2+."

[3] "Importantly, divalent Ga species balancing paired framework Al sites are redox-inactive, indicating an oxidation state of +3 for Ga."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

6. Yes, the article uses in situ infrared spectroscopy to probe oxidation state changes of active Ga species during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it demonstrates that the highly active divalent Ga species balancing paired framework Al sites are redox-inactive, indicating an oxidation state of +3 for the active Ga2O2 species. The lack of Ga hydride bands on Co-exchanged zeolites further supports this +3 assignment.

6. 是的,��文献使用原位红外光谱学来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中活性Ga物种的氧化态变化。具体来说,它证明了平衡成对铝框架位的高活性二价Ga物种是惰性的,表示活性Ga2O2物种的氧化态为+3。Co交换沸石上Ga氢化物带的缺失进一步支持了这个+3的归属。

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques including pulse reactions, infrared spectroscopy, and XANES to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Examples include using a pulse reactor setup to differentiate Ga species based on redox properties, identifying Ga2O22+ as the highly active species via in-situ infrared spectroscopy, and attempting to determine Ga oxidation states with XANES despite challenges with low Ga loadings.

[2] "Although XANES band assignments remain debated on Ga/H-ZSM-5."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses XANES to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. However, there are challenges in using XANES to definitively determine Ga oxidation states due to the low Ga loadings where Ga2O22+ is dominant, and debate over XANES band assignments for Ga species.  
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答案:是的,该文章使用XANES来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。然而,由于Ga2O22+占主导地位时Ga载量较低,以及对Ga物种的XANES带分配存在争议,使用XANES明确确定Ga氧化态存在挑战。
