         [1] "Despite the mounting evidence supporting the correlation between paired framework Al sites density and enhanced PDH activity, the identity of the highly active Ga species remains controversial." 

         [2] "Little experimental evidence has been gathered regarding the composition and structure of the most active Ga species, though several structures have been proposed via computational studies."
         
         [3] "The assignments of the infrared bands located at 2037 and 2053 cm−1 to [GaH2]+ and [GaH]2+ species, respectively, also need to be reassessed." 
         
         [4] "X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) was repeatedly employed to determine the oxidation state of Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5, the low absolute Ga loadings, at which Ga2O22+ is the primary Ga species in the sample, make it difficult to provide definitive information."
         
         [5] "Infrared bands at 2037 and 2053 cm−1 upon H2 treatment of Ga/H-ZSM-5 are attributed to HGa2O2+···H+ cation pair (Scheme 1) via the heterolytic dissociative adsorption of H2 on Ga2O22+. HGa2O2+···H+ is not a stable species, as its IR band decays quickly under vacuum at 550 °C via the reformation of Ga2O22+ and desorption of H2."
         
         [6] "The Ga loading on Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.042) is 0.28 wt %, which is at least a factor of 3 lower than those employed in previous studies."

         The article summarizes remaining challenges and knowledge gaps in propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It states that the identity and structure of the most active gallium species remains controversial, with little definitive experimental evidence gathered so far. Specific issues highlighted include the need to reassess previous infrared band assignments used to characterize gallium species, and the difficulty of using X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the low gallium loadings where the most active species dominates. It also notes challenges in characterizing proposed cation pairs like HGa2O2+∙∙∙H+ believed to be involved in the reaction mechanism. Overall, definitive characterization of the gallium active site structure and composition at real catalyst loadings is called out as a remaining gap needing further research.

         该文献总结了丙烷脱氢催化剂方面的剩余挑战和知识空白。它指出最活跃的镓化合物的身份和结构仍存在争议,目前获得的确定性实验证据很少。具体的问题包括需要重新评估用于表征镓化合物的红外波段指配,以及在镓加载较低的情况下难以使用X射线吸收光谱法,而这种加载下镓的最活跃物种占主导地位。它还指出了表征认为参与反应机理的提议的阳离子对如HGa2O2+∙∙∙H+的挑战。总的来说,在实际催化剂加载下对镓活跃位点的组成和结构进行明确表征被指出是一个尚需进一步研究的空白。
