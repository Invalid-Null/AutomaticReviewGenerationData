<quotes>

[1] Ga/H-ZSM-5 is a prominent candidate. (1013)

[2] Phadke et al. (11) claimed that [GaH]2+ species anchored by Al pair sites are the active centers for the PDH, while Schreiber et al. (10) believed that the Ga+H+ pair is more reactive than isolated Ga+ sites. 

[3] This insight suggests that the synthesis of H-ZSM-5 with enriched paired framework Al atoms could be a fruitful strategy in enhancing the PDH activity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. The article explains that catalysts like Ga/H-ZSM-5 can facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing active sites that lower the activation energy barrier. The active sites are proposed to be divalent gallium species like [GaH]2+ or Ga+H+ pairs anchored on paired framework Al atoms in the zeolite, which are more reactive than isolated Ga+ sites. Enriching H-ZSM-5 with more paired Al sites is suggested as a strategy to improve catalyst activity.

</English version answer>

<quotes>

[1] Determination of the structure of Ga-containing catalytic sites in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction on Ga/H-ZSM-5 has been a long-standing challenge for understanding Ga-based catalysts but has been hampered by the complexity of the system.

[2] We recently determined the intrinsic PDH activities of two types of Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (14) and found that Ga species balancing negative framework charges associated with paired Al atoms exhibit higher reaction rates than isolated Ga+ sites by a factor of 15 in terms of turnover frequency (TOF).

[3] This insight suggests that the synthesis of H-ZSM-5 with enriched paired framework Al atoms could be a fruitful strategy in enhancing the PDH activity of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. The article explains that catalysts like Ga/H-ZSM-5 facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing catalytic sites that balance paired framework Al atoms, lowering activation barriers. It also states that Ga species associated with paired Al atoms have 15 times higher turnover frequency than isolated Ga+ sites, suggesting synthesis of H-ZSM-5 with more paired Al could enhance PDH activity.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

2.这篇文章解释说,Ga/H-ZSM-5等催化剂通过提供平衡成对的框架Al原子的催化位点来促进丙烷脱氢,降低激活能垒。它还指出,与成对Al原子相关的Ga种与隔离的Ga+位点相比,周转频率高15倍,这表明合成具有更多成对Al的H-ZSM-5可以增强PDH活性。

<quotes>

[1] On-demand production of ethylene and propylene via the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes is an effective strategy in the making up for the supplydemand gap of alkenes as shale gas share as a hydrocarbon feedstock continues to rise. 

[2] Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes is thermodynamically favorable; however, maintaining selectivity control at high conversions remains challenging.

[3] Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, though limited by thermodynamics, has much potential for catalyst improvement as current commercial processes operate substantially below equilibrium conversions.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

4. The article discusses that propane dehydrogenation is thermodynamically limited, but nonoxidative PDH has potential for catalyst improvement since current processes operate below equilibrium conversion. It also mentions that oxidative PDH is favorable thermodynamically but maintaining selectivity is challenging.

</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>

4.这篇文章讨论了丙烷脱氢在热力学上是受限的,但非氧化丙烷脱氢具有催化剂改进的潜力,因为当前的工艺远低于平衡转换率。它还提到氧化丙烷脱氢在热力学上是有利的,但保持选择性是具有挑战性的。
