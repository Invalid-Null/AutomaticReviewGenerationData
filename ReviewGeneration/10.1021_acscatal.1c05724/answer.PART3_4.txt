<quotes>
[1] "we employed quantitative in situ FTIR spectroscopy and pulse titration reactions to determine the identity of the highly active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts"

[2] "Infrared spectra of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.31) treated with a mixture of H2 and D2 suggest that [GaH2]+ is unlikely to be present in the reduced sample."

[3] "PDH activity of oxidized isolated Ga species is largely unknown because they are typically reduced during catalyst activation prior to the PDH."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in situ FTIR spectroscopy and pulse titration reactions to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Examples include identifying the active Ga species on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, ruling out the presence of [GaH2]+ species, and finding that oxidized isolated Ga species have some PDH activity.
