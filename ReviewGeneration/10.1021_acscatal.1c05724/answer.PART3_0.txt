<quotes>

[1] "We employed quantitative in situ FTIR spectroscopy and pulse titration reactions to determine the identity of the highly active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in the PDH."

[2] "Oxygen consumption results, together with the fraction of BAS displaced by the Ga site, can be used to determine the density of the divalent Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), which is referred to as GaxOy2+ before its composition is proposed later in this work."

[3] "Infrared spectra of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.31) treated with a mixture of H2 and D2 suggest that [GaH2]+ is unlikely to be present in the reduced sample."
