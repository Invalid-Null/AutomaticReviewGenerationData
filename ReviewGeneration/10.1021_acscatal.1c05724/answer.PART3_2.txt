<quotes>
[1] "Ga supported on Co-H-ZSM-5 samples with a fixed Si/Al ratio of 15 were prepared to further establish the correlation between the ability to stabilize GaHx species and framework Al pairs."

[2] "The inability of the divalent Ga species to stabilize Ga hydride species is demonstrated by the lack of the infrared bands for Ga hydride on Co-H-ZSM-5 support, where all paired framework Al sites are occupied by Co2+."
</quotes>

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes preparing Ga supported on Co-H-ZSM-5 samples to establish a correlation between stabilizing GaHx species and framework Al pairs. It also shows that divalent Ga species cannot stabilize Ga hydride species when paired framework Al sites are occupied by Co2+.

3. 是的,这篇文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它描述了在Co-H-ZSM-5上制备载Ga样品,以建立GaHx物种的稳定性与框架Al位点对之间的相关性。它还表明,当成对的框架Al位点被Co2+占据时,二价Ga物种不能稳定Ga氢化物种。

<quotes>  
[1] "Pulse reactions with 10 vol % O2 (with balancing N2) were employed to determine the composition of Ga species on reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples."

[2] "Infrared spectra of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.31) treated with a mixture of H2 and D2 suggest that [GaH2]+ is unlikely to be present in the reduced sample."

[3] "We propose that Ga2O22+ is the divalent Ga species balancing paired framework Al sites (referred to as GaxOy2+ in the text above) given that Ga is present in the oxidation state of +3 without any hydride."

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses pulse reactions with O2 to determine Ga species composition in reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 samples. It also uses in-situ infrared spectroscopy with H2/D2 mixtures to show [GaH2]+ is unlikely present. The article proposes Ga2O22+ as the divalent Ga species balancing paired framework Al sites based on its +3 oxidation state without hydride.

4. 是的,这篇文章利用了原位表征技术来研究正在工作的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它使用O2脉冲反应来确定Ga/H-ZSM-5样品中Ga物种的组成。它还使用H2/D2混合物的原位红外光谱表明[GaH2]+ 不太可能存在。根据Ga的+3氧化态且没有氢化物,这篇文章提出Ga2O2^2+是平衡成对框架Al位点的二价Ga物种。
