To generate the consistency ratios, I compared each answer file's English version answer to the correct English version answer provided. I counted the number of overlapping content words between the two answers, divided by the total number of content words in the correct answer, to calculate a percentage representing consistency. This provides a rough quantitative measure of consistency, though has limitations in perfectly assessing semantic equivalence. For question 4, some answers provided additional relevant information beyond what was in the correct answer, so I scored those partially correct rather than 100% inconsistent. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
