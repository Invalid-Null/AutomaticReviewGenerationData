 Here is the JSON structure comparing the answer files to the correct answers:

```json

To generate this, I compared the English answers from each file to the correct English answers provided. I calculated a consistency percentage based on semantic similarity. 100% indicates the answers are fully consistent, while lower percentages indicate greater inconsistency. The keys match the question numbers, and the filename keys indicate the consistency ratio for that file's answer to the respective question.
