         [1] "Ga supported on Co-H-ZSM-5 samples with a fixed Si/Al ratio of 15 were prepared to further establish the correlation between the ability to stabilize GaHx species and framework Al pairs."
         [2] "The inability of the divalent Ga species to stabilize Ga hydride species is demonstrated by the lack of the infrared bands for Ga hydride on Co-H-ZSM-5 support, where all paired framework Al sites are occupied by Co2+."

      <English>
         Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes preparing Ga supported on Co-H-ZSM-5 samples to establish a correlation between stabilizing GaHx species and framework Al pairs. It also shows that divalent Ga species cannot stabilize Ga hydride species when paired framework Al sites are occupied by Co2+.

         是的,这篇文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它描述了在Co-H-ZSM-5上制备载Ga样品,以建立GaHx物种的稳定性与框架Al位点对之间的相关性。它还表明,当成对的框架Al位点被Co^2+占据时,二价Ga物种不能稳定Ga氢化物种。

         [1] "We employed quantitative in situ FTIR spectroscopy and pulse titration reactions to determine the identity of the highly active Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts in the PDH."
         [2] "Oxygen consumption results, together with the fraction of BAS displaced by the Ga site, can be used to determine the density of the divalent Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y), which is referred to as GaxOy2+ before its composition is proposed later in this work." 
         [3] "Infrared spectra of Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 0.31) treated with a mixture of H2 and D2 suggest that [GaH2]+ is unlikely to be present in the reduced sample."
         [4] "Consequently, the amount of water produced during the reduction of as-synthesized Ga/H-ZSM-5 was determined by monitoring the 18 amu signal with an online mass spectrometer (MS) during reduction of the sample in flowing H2 (10 vol %) at 550 C (Figure 1a)."
         [5] "This is the typical activation condition employed prior to the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction."
         [6] "One example MS spectrum of the O2 pulse reaction is shown in Figure 1a, in which the first eight pulses of O2 are completely consumed by reduced Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, 1.7)."
         [7] "The molar ratio between water formed in the reduction and oxygen consumed in Ga/H-ZSM-5 (15, Y) samples (Y = 01.7) is determined to be close to 1.5 (1.6 ± 0.1, in Figures 1b, S3, and S4), confirming that Ga2O3 in as-synthesized samples is reduced to Ga+ during this process, as reported by Lercher and co-workers."

         Yes, the article utilizes in situ characterization techniques including FTIR spectroscopy, pulse titration reactions, and mass spectrometry to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it employs quantitative in situ FTIR spectroscopy and pulse titration reactions with H2 and O2 to determine the identity and composition of active Ga species. It also monitors H2O production during catalyst reduction and O2 consumption during reoxidation using online mass spectrometry. These techniques provide insights into the oxidation state changes of Ga species during PDH catalysis.
