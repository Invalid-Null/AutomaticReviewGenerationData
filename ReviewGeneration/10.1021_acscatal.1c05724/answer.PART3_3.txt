[1] "The schematic of the pulse reactor setup (Figure S1) is included in the Supporting Information."

[2] "In situ infrared spectroscopic evidence, the highly active divalent Ga species is identified to be Ga2O22+."

[3] "X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) was repeatedly employed to determine the oxidation state of Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5, (10,12,3638) the low absolute Ga loadings, at which Ga2O22+ is the primary Ga species in the sample, make it difficult to provide definitive information."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques including pulse reactions, infrared spectroscopy, and XANES to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Examples include using a pulse reactor setup to differentiate Ga species based on redox properties, identifying Ga2O22+ as the highly active species via in-situ infrared spectroscopy, and attempting to determine Ga oxidation states with XANES despite challenges with low Ga loadings.

[1] "X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) was repeatedly employed to determine the oxidation state of Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5, (10,12,3638) the low absolute Ga loadings, at which Ga2O22+ is the primary Ga species in the sample, make it difficult to provide definitive information."

[2] "Although XANES band assignments remain debated on Ga/H-ZSM-5."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses XANES to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. However, there are challenges in using XANES to definitively determine Ga oxidation states due to the low Ga loadings where Ga2O22+ is dominant, and debate over XANES band assignments for Ga species.  
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答案:是的,该文章使用XANES来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。然而,由于Ga2O22+占主导地位时Ga载量较低,以及对Ga物种的XANES带分配存在争议,使用XANES明确确定Ga氧化态存在挑战。
