<quotes>
[1] Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination and then act as the anchoring sites for Pt species.

[2] Supported Pt catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method. The Si-Beta or the as-synthesized Zn/Si-Beta were impregnated in the [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2 solution at room temperature for 4 h.
</quotes>

<English version answer> 
Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It utilizes dealumination to create silanol defects in the zeolite framework, which act as anchoring sites to stabilize dispersed Zn species. The Zn species then anchor highly dispersed Pt species prepared by incipient wetness impregnation.

<quotes>
[1] The morphology of the zeolite support and the dispersion of Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta support were directly investigated by electron microscopy and the representative results are shown in Fig. 2. 

[2] STEM mapping analyses reveal the presence of both highly-dispersed Zn species (<1 nm) and small aggregates (1 ∼ 2.5 nm). Meanwhile, no aggregation of Pt species could be observed due to its high dispersion and low loading.

[3] In contrast to the fresh sample (Fig. 2), the aggregation of Pt species in spent 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta (after PDH reaction for 150 h) is confirmed by element mapping analysis.

<English version answer>
Answer: The article employs advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses TEM and STEM to show highly dispersed Zn and Pt species on the zeolite support in fresh catalysts. STEM mapping also reveals Pt aggregation in spent catalysts after propane dehydrogenation reaction.
