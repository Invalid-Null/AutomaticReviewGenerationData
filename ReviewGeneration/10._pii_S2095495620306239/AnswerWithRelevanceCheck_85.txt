         [1] "Supported Pt catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method." 
         [2] "In order to obtain an optimal PDH catalyst, the effects of Pt and Zn loadings in Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalysts on PDH performance were further investigated."
         [3] Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination and then act as the anchoring sites for Pt species.
         [4] Supported Pt catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method. The Si-Beta or the as-synthesized Zn/Si-Beta were impregnated in the [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2 solution at room temperature for 4 h.
         [5] "Zn-containing zeolite Beta, i.e. Zn/Si-Beta, was prepared via a two-step post-synthesis procedure consisting of the dealumination of the H-Beta to obtain the Si-Beta material and the subsequent stabilization of Zn by the silanol defects."
         [6] "Supported Pt catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method. The Si-Beta or the as-synthesized Zn/Si-Beta were impregnated in the [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2 solution at room temperature for 4 h."
         [7] "TEM and STEM elemental mapping images of 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta sample."
         [8] "The aggregation of Pt species indicates the spatial separation of Pt and Zn species and the weakening of Pt-Zn interaction [49], [50], [51], which is not good for PDH reaction."

         Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses techniques like incipient wetness impregnation to load Pt and Zn species onto the zeolite support. It also utilizes zeolite dealumination to create silanol anchoring sites that stabilize dispersed Zn species. The effects of Pt and Zn loadings are studied to optimize dispersion and catalytic performance. Electron microscopy and mapping are used to characterize the dispersion.

         [1] "The morphology of the zeolite support and the dispersion of Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta support were directly investigated by electron microscopy and the representative results are shown in Fig. 2."
         [2] "In the HR-TEM image, homogeneously dispersed dark dots of 1 ∼ 2.5 nm could be observed. STEM mapping analyses reveal the presence of both highly-dispersed Zn species (<1 nm) and small aggregates (1 ∼ 2.5 nm)."  
         [3] "Obviously, Pt and Zn species appear in the overlapped locations, hinting to the close contact between Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite support."
         [4] "In contrast to the fresh sample (Fig. 2), the aggregation of Pt species in spent 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta (after PDH reaction for 150 h) is confirmed by element mapping analysis."
         [5] "The morphology of the zeolite support and the dispersion of Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta support were directly investigated by electron microscopy and the representative results are shown in Fig. 2."
         [6] "In the HR-TEM image, homogeneously dispersed dark dots of 1 - 2.5 nm could be observed. STEM mapping analyses reveal the presence of both highly-dispersed Zn species (<1 nm) and small aggregates (1 - 2.5 nm)."
         [7] "TEM and STEM elemental mapping images of 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta sample."
         [8] "the aggregation of Pt species in spent 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta (after PDH reaction for 150 h) is confirmed by element mapping analysis." 
         [9] The article employs advanced microscopy techniques like TEM and STEM to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows highly dispersed Pt and Zn species on the zeolite support with close contact between them. TEM of spent catalysts also reveals aggregation of Pt species during reaction.
