         [1] "Supported Pt catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method." 
         [2] "In order to obtain an optimal PDH catalyst, the effects of Pt and Zn loadings in Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalysts on PDH performance were further investigated."
         [3] Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination and then act as the anchoring sites for Pt species. 
         [4] Supported Pt catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method. The Si-Beta or the as-synthesized Zn/Si-Beta were impregnated in the [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2 solution at room temperature for 4 h.
         [5] "Zn-containing zeolite Beta, i.e. Zn/Si-Beta, was prepared via a two-step post-synthesis procedure consisting of the dealumination of the H-Beta to obtain the Si-Beta material and the subsequent stabilization of Zn by the silanol defects."
         [6] "Supported Pt catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method." 
         [7] "The final products were denoted as xPt-yZn/Si-Beta, where × and y represent the weight percentage (wt%) of Zn and Pt, respectively."
         [8] "TEM and STEM elemental mapping images of 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta sample."
         [9] "The aggregation of Pt species indicates the spatial separation of Pt and Zn species and the weakening of Pt-Zn interaction [49], [50], [51], which is not good for PDH reaction."

         Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses incipient wetness impregnation to load Pt and Zn onto the zeolite support. It studies the effects of different metal loadings to optimize dispersion and catalytic performance. It also utilizes dealumination to create anchoring sites for dispersed Zn and Pt species. TEM and STEM mapping reveal close contact between Pt and Zn species when highly dispersed, and aggregation of Pt during reaction leads to deactivation.

         答:是的,文章研究了针对优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它使用浸渍湿法在分子筛支持体上加载Pt和Zn。它研究不同金属负载量的效应,以优化分散和催化性能。它还利用除铝来创建Zn和Pt物种的锚定位点。TEM和STEM映射表明,高度分散的Pt和Zn物种之间有密切接触,而反应过程中的Pt聚集导致失活。

         [1] "The morphology of the zeolite support and the dispersion of Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta support were directly investigated by electron microscopy and the representative results are shown in Fig. 2."
         [2] "In the HR-TEM image, homogeneously dispersed dark dots of 1 ∼ 2.5 nm could be observed. STEM mapping analyses reveal the presence of both highly-dispersed Zn species (<1 nm) and small aggregates (1 ∼ 2.5 nm)."
         [3] "Obviously, Pt and Zn species appear in the overlapped locations, hinting to the close contact between Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite support." 
         [4] "In contrast to the fresh sample (Fig. 2), the aggregation of Pt species in spent 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta (after PDH reaction for 150 h) is confirmed by element mapping analysis."
         [5] "The morphology of the zeolite support and the dispersion of Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta support were directly investigated by electron microscopy and the representative results are shown in Fig. 2."
         [6] "In the HR-TEM image, homogeneously dispersed dark dots of 1 - 2.5 nm could be observed. STEM mapping analyses reveal the presence of both highly-dispersed Zn species (<1 nm) and small aggregates (1 - 2.5 nm)."
         [7] "Meanwhile, no aggregation of Pt species could be observed due to its high dispersion and low loading. Obviously, Pt and Zn species appear in the overlapped locations, hinting to the close contact between Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite support."
         [8] "TEM and STEM elemental mapping images of 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta sample."

         Answer: Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques like TEM, HR-TEM and STEM to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It provides examples of observing highly dispersed Pt and Zn species in close contact on the zeolite support, as well as aggregation of Pt after reaction leading to deactivation.
