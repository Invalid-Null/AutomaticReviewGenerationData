[3] "TEM and STEM elemental mapping images of 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta sample."

[4] "The aggregation of Pt species indicates the spatial separation of Pt and Zn species and the weakening of Pt-Zn interaction [49], [50], [51], which is not good for PDH reaction."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses a two-step post-synthesis procedure to stabilize Zn species in the zeolite pores, and then loads Pt species by incipient wetness impregnation. TEM and STEM mapping confirm high dispersion of Pt and Zn species with close contact between them. Aggregation of Pt species during reaction leads to spatial separation from Zn and is linked to deactivation.
