[1] "Pt-based bimetallic catalysts such as Pt-Ti [9], Pt-Ga [6], [10], Pt-Cu [1], Pt-Sn [11], [12], [13], and Pt-Zn [14] have been intensively investigated in the past decades, and the Oleflex PDH process with Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst has been successfully commercialized by UOP [6]."
[2] "Zn, a highly abundant and non-toxic metal, has been explored as a promising modifier of Pt for PDH, but receives much less attention than the post-transition-metals Ga [6], [10] and Sn [11], [12]."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
2. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates Pt alloy catalysts including Pt-Sn, Pt-Ga, and Pt-Zn for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing Pt-Zn/Si-Beta has high activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation, though Pt-Zn has received less attention than Pt-Sn and Pt-Ga. The Oleflex commercial process uses Pt-Sn/Al2O3.

2. 答案:是的,本文评估了Pt合金催化剂,包括Pt-Sn、Pt-Ga和Pt-Zn,用于丙烷脱氢。它提供的数据显�Pt-Zn/Si-Beta对丙烷脱氢有很高的活性和选择性,尽管Pt-Zn得到的关注比Pt-Sn和Pt-Ga要少。Oleflex商业过程使用Pt-Sn/Al2O3。

<quotes>
[1] "The formation of solely linearly-adsorbed CO hints to the existence of highly dispersed Pt species of 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta zeolite, in good agreement with TEM observations. Obviously, the presence of Zn is helpful for the dispersion of Pt species [36]." 
[2] "With electrons transfer from Zn species to Pt species, the Zn species become electron-deficient and Lewis acidic thereof. In other word, the observed Lewis acidity in 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta as compared to 2Zn/Si-Beta should indicate the strong interaction between Pt and Zn species on the Si-Beta support."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
3. Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of Zn as the secondary metal in the Pt-Zn bimetallic catalyst. It shows Zn helps disperse Pt and there is electron transfer from Zn to Pt, making Zn electron deficient. This indicates a strong interaction between Pt and Zn, modifying the electronic structure and acidity.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 
3. 答案:是的,本文研究了Zn作为Pt-Zn双金属催化剂中的次要金属的电子和几何效应。它显示Zn有助于 Pt的分散,并且从Zn向Pt发生电子转移,使Zn电子亏损。这表明Pt和Zn之间有强互作用,改变了电子结构和酸度。
