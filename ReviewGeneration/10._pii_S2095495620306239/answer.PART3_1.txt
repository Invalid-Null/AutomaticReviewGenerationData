<quotes>
[1] "2Zn/Si-Beta appears to be active in PDH and the propane conversion of ∼15% with ∼90% selectivity toward propylene can be at high temperatures of >823K."

[2] "In order to obtain an optimal PDH catalyst, the effects of Pt and Zn loadings in Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalysts on PDH performance were further investigated."  

[3] "That is, monometallic Pt supported on Si-Beta zeolite cannot catalyze the PDH well."

[4] "An optimized Pt/Zn ratio with the close contact and electronic interaction between Pt and Zn species is essential for the success of 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta catalyst."

[5] "Framework vacant sites created from dealumination, i.e. the silanol groups, can act as the anchoring sites for Zn and Pt-Zn species and therefore ensure the homogeneous dispersion of Pt-Zn species."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies the effects of Pt and Zn loadings to optimize the Pt/Zn ratio and achieve close contact and electronic interaction between Pt and Zn species. It also utilizes dealumination to create silanol groups as anchoring sites for Zn and Pt-Zn species to ensure homogeneous dispersion.

[1] "The morphology of the zeolite support and the dispersion of Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta support were directly investigated by electron microscopy and the representative results are shown in Fig. 2."

[2] "In the HR-TEM image, homogeneously dispersed dark dots of 1 ∼ 2.5 nm could be observed. STEM mapping analyses reveal the presence of both highly-dispersed Zn species (<1 nm) and small aggregates (1 ∼ 2.5 nm)." 

[3] "Obviously, Pt and Zn species appear in the overlapped locations, hinting to the close contact between Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite support."

[4] "In contrast to the fresh sample (Fig. 2), the aggregation of Pt species in spent 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta (after PDH reaction for 150 h) is confirmed by element mapping analysis."
