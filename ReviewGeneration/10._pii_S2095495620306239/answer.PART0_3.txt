 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the literature that directly answer the questions asked. The provided scientific article focuses on describing the development and optimization of a Pt-Zn/Si-Beta zeolite catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. While it provides some background on the importance of propylene production, it does not substantially discuss the broader context of propane dehydrogenation such as thermodynamics, kinetics, computational studies, structure-activity relationships, etc.
