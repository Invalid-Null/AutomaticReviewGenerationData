<quotes>
[1] "Zn-containing zeolite Beta, i.e. Zn/Si-Beta, was prepared via a two-step post-synthesis procedure consisting of the dealumination of the H-Beta to obtain the Si-Beta material and the subsequent stabilization of Zn by the silanol defects."

[2] "Supported Pt catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method." 

[3] "The final products were denoted as xPt-yZn/Si-Beta, where × and y represent the weight percentage (wt%) of Zn and Pt, respectively."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes a two-step post-synthesis procedure to first stabilize Zn species on dealuminated zeolite Beta by interaction with silanol defects, followed by impregnation with Pt. The Pt and Zn loadings are systematically varied and optimized.

[1] "The morphology of the zeolite support and the dispersion of Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta support were directly investigated by electron microscopy and the representative results are shown in Fig. 2."

[2] "In the HR-TEM image, homogeneously dispersed dark dots of 1 - 2.5 nm could be observed. STEM mapping analyses reveal the presence of both highly-dispersed Zn species (<1 nm) and small aggregates (1 - 2.5 nm)." 

[3] "Meanwhile, no aggregation of Pt species could be observed due to its high dispersion and low loading. Obviously, Pt and Zn species appear in the overlapped locations, hinting to the close contact between Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite support."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques like HR-TEM and STEM to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It provides examples showing highly dispersed Pt and Zn species with sizes <2.5 nm in close contact on the zeolite support. 
</English version answer>
