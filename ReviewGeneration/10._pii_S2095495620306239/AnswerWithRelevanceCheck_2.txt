         [1] "Supported Pt catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method." 
         [2] "In order to obtain an optimal PDH catalyst, the effects of Pt and Zn loadings in Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalysts on PDH performance were further investigated."
         [3] Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination and then act as the anchoring sites for Pt species. 
         [4] Supported Pt catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method. The Si-Beta or the as-synthesized Zn/Si-Beta were impregnated in the [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2 solution at room temperature for 4 h.
         [5] "Zn-containing zeolite Beta, i.e. Zn/Si-Beta, was prepared via a two-step post-synthesis procedure consisting of the dealumination of the H-Beta to obtain the Si-Beta material and the subsequent stabilization of Zn by the silanol defects."
         [6] "Supported Pt catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method. The Si-Beta or the as-synthesized Zn/Si-Beta were impregnated in the [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2 solution at room temperature for 4 h." 
         [7] "TEM and STEM elemental mapping images of 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta sample."
         [8] "The aggregation of Pt species indicates the spatial separation of Pt and Zn species and the weakening of Pt-Zn interaction [49], [50], [51], which is not good for PDH reaction."

         Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It utilizes dealumination to create silanol groups that stabilize dispersed Zn species. The Zn species act as anchors for highly dispersed Pt prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. The Pt and Zn loadings are optimized for close contact and interaction. TEM and STEM confirm homogeneous dispersion and interfacial contact. Pt aggregation during reaction indicates weakened metal-support interaction and deactivation.

         答:文章研究了针对优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它利用了脱铝过程在分子筛框架中创建硅醇基团,这些基团起到稳定分散Zn物种的作用。然后Zn物种固定高度分散的Pt物种,Pt物种是通过incipient wetness浸渍法制备的。 Pt和Zn的负载量经过优化,使其实现密切接触和相互作用。TEM 和 STEM 确认均匀分散和界面接触。反应过程中Pt聚集表示金属支撑体相互作用削弱和失活。

         [1] "The morphology of the zeolite support and the dispersion of Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta support were directly investigated by electron microscopy and the representative results are shown in Fig. 2."
         [2] "In the HR-TEM image, homogeneously dispersed dark dots of 1 ∼ 2.5 nm could be observed. STEM mapping analyses reveal the presence of both highly-dispersed Zn species (<1 nm) and small aggregates (1 ∼ 2.5 nm)."
         [3] "Obviously, Pt and Zn species appear in the overlapped locations, hinting to the close contact between Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite support." 
         [4] "In contrast to the fresh sample (Fig. 2), the aggregation of Pt species in spent 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta (after PDH reaction for 150 h) is confirmed by element mapping analysis."
         [5] "The morphology of the zeolite support and the dispersion of Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta support were directly investigated by electron microscopy and the representative results are shown in Fig. 2."
         [6] "In the HR-TEM image, homogeneously dispersed dark dots of 1 - 2.5 nm could be observed. STEM mapping analyses reveal the presence of both highly-dispersed Zn species (<1 nm) and small aggregates (1 - 2.5 nm)."

         Answer: The article employs advanced microscopy techniques like HR-TEM, STEM, TEM and elemental mapping to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It demonstrates homogeneous dispersion of sub-2.5 nm Pt and Zn species in close contact on the zeolite support. Pt aggregation was observed in spent catalysts indicating weakened metal-support interaction.

         答:文章采用了HR-TEM、STEM、TEM以及元素映射等先进的显微技术来表征丙烷脱氢催化剂中的金属-支撑体界面。它展示了亚2.5 nm Pt和Zn种高度分散并在分子筛支撑体上有密切接触。在反应后的催化剂中观察到Pt聚集,表明金属支撑体相互作用削弱。
