[1] Pt-based bimetallic catalysts such as Pt-Ti [9], Pt-Ga [6], [10], Pt-Cu [1], Pt-Sn [11], [12], [13], and Pt-Zn [14] have been intensively investigated in the past decades, and the Oleflex PDH process with Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst has been successfully commercialized by UOP [6]. For all cases, the introduction of the second metal species with strong interaction could significantly promote the activity and the stability of Pt species in PDH reaction [9].

[1] In order to investigate the role of Zn on Pt in the bicomponent catalyst, the effects of Pt-Zn loading order on the PDH performance were further investigated. 
[2] With electrons transfer from Zn species to Pt species, the Zn species become electron-deficient and Lewis acidic thereof. In other word, the observed Lewis acidity in 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta as compared to 2Zn/Si-Beta should indicate the strong interaction between Pt and Zn species on the Si-Beta support.

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal Zn in the Pt-Zn bimetallic catalyst. It shows that the loading order affects performance, indicating a synergistic interaction between Pt and Zn. It also shows electron transfer from Zn to Pt species, making Zn electron deficient and revealing strong metal-metal interaction.

[1] For all cases, the introduction of the second metal species with strong interaction could significantly promote the activity and the stability of Pt species in PDH reaction [9].
[2] An optimized Pt/Zn ratio with the close contact and electronic interaction between Pt and Zn species is essential for the success of 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta catalyst.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article describes synergistic effects between metals in the bimetallic Pt-Zn catalyst, attributed to ensemble and electronic interaction effects. It shows the second metal Zn promotes Pt activity and stability via strong metal-metal interactions. An optimized Pt/Zn ratio is needed for close contact and electronic interactions between the metals.

<quotes>
[1] In our previous work, bicomponent Pt-Sn species stabilized by Si-Beta zeolite has been established as a good catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) [22], which exhibited high propylene productivity and good stability due to the confinement effects of Si-Beta [23], [24], [25].
[2] In view of the known activity of Pt and Pt-Zn in PDH and the contribution of Si-Beta support from the so-called confinement effect, we herein report the design and construction of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalysts for PDH.
