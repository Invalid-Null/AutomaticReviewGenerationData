[1] The close contact between Pt-Zn species and the electronic interaction thereof make Pt-Zn/Si-Beta robust PDH catalysts.
[2] The band of 2075 cm−1 can be assigned to the CO molecules linearly adsorbed in an on-top geometry on Pt atoms on single-crystal or nanoparticle surfaces and the band of 2120 cm−1 belongs to the CO molecules linearly adsorbed on Pt single atoms. The formation of solely linearly-adsorbed CO hints to the existence of highly dispersed Pt species of 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta zeolite, in good agreement with TEM observations. Obviously, the presence of Zn is helpful for the dispersion of Pt species [36].
[3] These results show that the modulation of Pt by Zn species, i.e. the electron transfer from Zn to Pt species, can enrich the electron density of Pt and thus weaken the electron-rich propylene adsorption [1], [4]. Accordingly, the deep dehydrogenation and the formation of coke deposits can be greatly suppressed, as confirmed by the result from TG-DSC analysis in Fig. S6.
