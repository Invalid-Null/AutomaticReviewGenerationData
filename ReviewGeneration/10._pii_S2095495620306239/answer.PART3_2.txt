[1] "Zn-containing zeolite Beta, i.e. Zn/Si-Beta, was prepared via a two-step post-synthesis procedure consisting of the dealumination of the H-Beta to obtain the Si-Beta material and the subsequent stabilization of Zn by the silanol defects."

[2] "Supported Pt catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method. The Si-Beta or the as-synthesized Zn/Si-Beta were impregnated in the [Pt(NH3)4](NO3)2 solution at room temperature for 4 h."

[3] "TEM and STEM elemental mapping images of 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta sample."

[4] "The aggregation of Pt species indicates the spatial separation of Pt and Zn species and the weakening of Pt-Zn interaction [49], [50], [51], which is not good for PDH reaction."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses a two-step post-synthesis procedure to stabilize Zn species in the zeolite pores, and then loads Pt species by incipient wetness impregnation. TEM and STEM mapping confirm high dispersion of Pt and Zn species with close contact between them. Aggregation of Pt species during reaction leads to spatial separation from Zn and is linked to deactivation.

回答:该文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它使用两步后期合成工艺在分子筛孔内稳定Zn种,然后用浸渍湿法加载Pt种。TEM和STEM映射确认Pt和Zn种高度分散,两者之间有密切接触。反应过程中Pt种的聚集导致与Zn的空间分离,并与失活有关。

[1] "The morphology of the zeolite support and the dispersion of Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta support were directly investigated by electron microscopy and the representative results are shown in Fig. 2." 

[2] "In the HR-TEM image, homogeneously dispersed dark dots of 1 − 2.5 nm could be observed. STEM mapping analyses reveal the presence of both highly-dispersed Zn species (<1 nm) and small aggregates (1 − 2.5 nm)."

[3] "TEM and STEM elemental mapping images of 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta sample."

[4] "the aggregation of Pt species in spent 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta (after PDH reaction for 150 h) is confirmed by element mapping analysis."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article employs TEM and STEM microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows highly dispersed Pt and Zn species on the zeolite support with close contact between them. TEM of spent catalysts also reveals aggregation of Pt species during reaction.
