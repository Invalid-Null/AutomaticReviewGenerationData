[1] "Pt-based bimetallic catalysts such as Pt-Ti [9], Pt-Ga [6], [10], Pt-Cu [1], Pt-Sn [11], [12], [13], and Pt-Zn [14] have been intensively investigated in the past decades, and the Oleflex PDH process with Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst has been successfully commercialized by UOP [6]."

[2] "Zn, a highly abundant and non-toxic metal, has been explored as a promising modifier of Pt for PDH, but receives much less attention than the post-transition-metals Ga [6], [10] and Sn [11], [12]."

[3] "In view of the known activity of Pt and Pt-Zn in PDH and the contribution of Si-Beta support from the so-called confinement effect, we herein report the design and construction of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalysts for PDH."
