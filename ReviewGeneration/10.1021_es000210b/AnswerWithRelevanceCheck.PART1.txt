 Based on the answers provided, I do not see any relevant information to the questions asked about evaluating promising metal oxide catalysts, investigating their properties, proposing mechanistic scenarios, exploring metal-support effects, evaluating supported metal catalysts, investigating their properties, or proposing mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation specifically. 

The answers repeatedly state that the article/literature does not address these topics related to propane dehydrogenation. Therefore, I will stop my review and conclude:

※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※
