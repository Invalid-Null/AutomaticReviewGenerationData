<Answer>

 Unfortunately, after carefully reviewing the literature, I did not find any quotes or information relevant to answering the list of questions provided. The questions appear unrelated to the literature, which is a study on the interaction between calcium and phosphate adsorption on goethite. The literature does not discuss techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports, metal encapsulation methods, catalyst preparation optimization, in-situ propane dehydrogenation catalyst characterization, advanced microscopy techniques, X-ray techniques for probing oxidation states, or evaluation of different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation.
