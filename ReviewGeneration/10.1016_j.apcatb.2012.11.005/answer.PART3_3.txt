<English version answer>

1. No, the article does not describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. It focuses solely on SBA-15 as the support material.

2. No, the article does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. Propane dehydrogenation is only briefly mentioned, using Pt/SBA-15 catalysts.

3. Yes, the article investigates several catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion on the SBA-15 support. Methods discussed include wetness impregnation, deposition-precipitation, graft hybrid, colloid immobilization, and nanoparticle encapsulation.

4. No, the article does not utilize any in-situ characterization techniques to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Only CO oxidation and aerobic alcohol oxidation catalysts were studied in-situ. 

5. No, the article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Only conventional TEM is utilized.

6. No, the article does not use X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. XANES/EXAFS is only used to confirm Pt nanoparticle formation during catalyst synthesis.

7. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation. Only batch reactions are described.

1.不,本文没有描述在沸石型载体上合成离散单点位的技术。它仅专注于SBA-15作为载体材料。

2.不,本文没有评价金属包封在沸石型载体中以提高丙烷脱氢催化剂稳定性的方法。丙烷脱氢仅简要提及,使用Pt/SBA-15催化剂。

3.是的,本文调查了几种催化剂制备方法,旨在优化活性相在SBA-15载体上的分散。讨论的方法包括浸渍法、沉淀浸渍法、接枝杂化法、胶体固定化法和纳米颗粒包封法。

4.不,本文没有利用任何原位表征技术来研究工作中的丙烷脱氢催化剂。仅对CO氧化和含氧醇氧化催化剂进行了原位研究。

5.不,本文没有采用先进的显微技术来表征丙烷脱氢催化剂中的金属-载体界面。仅利用了常规TEM。

6.不,本文没有利用X射线技术探究丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。 XANES/EXAFS仅用于确认催化剂合成过程中的Pt纳米颗粒形成。

7.不,本文没有评价丙烷脱氢的不同反应器类型。仅描述了批量反应。
