 Unfortunately, the provided answers do not contain relevant information to address the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation. As the answers indicate, the literature focuses on Pt/SBA-15 catalysts and their applications, but does not provide details related to the propane dehydrogenation mechanisms, kinetics, thermodynamics, computational studies, or structure-activity relationships asked about in the questions.

Therefore, based on the assessment that the answers are not relevant to the questions, I will stop my review process and simply respond:

※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※
