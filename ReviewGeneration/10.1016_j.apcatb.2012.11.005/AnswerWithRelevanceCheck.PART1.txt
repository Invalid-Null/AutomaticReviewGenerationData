         [1] Pt/SBA-15 can be a catalyst not only for hydrogenation reactions, but also for dehydrogenation reactions. As an example, dehydrogenation of propane, which has the potential to make up the shortfall of propylene supply left by conventional crackers, has been investigated by many authors using Pt/SBA-15 as catalyst [126], [127], [128].

         Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt/SBA-15 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on the catalytic performance of Pt/SBA-15 catalysts prepared by wet impregnation (Pt/SBA-15_WI) and deposition-precipitation (Pt/SBA-15_DP) methods for propane dehydrogenation. 
      </English>
      <Chinese>  
         是的,本文评估了单金属受支持的Pt/SBA-15催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它提供了通过湿法浸渍法(Pt/SBA-15_ WI)和沉淀-沉积法(Pt/SBA-15_DP)制备的Pt/SBA-15催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的催化性能数据。

         [1] Table 4 lists the characters of Pt particle size of the two catalysts, measured from TEM, XRD and H2 chemisorption, which shows that the Pt particles of Pt/SBA-15_DP are far smaller than that of Pt/SBA-15_WI, and hence suggests that the DP method is more favorable for the preparation of small Pt particles than the WI method.

         [2] Dependence of activity on the reaction time showed that for Pt/SBA-15_DP, C3H8 conversion decreased and selectivity to C3H6 increased after a few minutes on stream. This was explained that the coke formed during the reaction improved the selectivity by deactivating the Pt sites that are highly active for Csingle bondC bond activation [22].

         Yes, the article investigates how properties like Pt particle size affect the performance of Pt/SBA-15 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that the Pt/SBA-15_DP catalyst prepared by deposition-precipitation method has much smaller Pt particles than the Pt/SBA-15_WI catalyst prepared by wet impregnation.

         是的,本文研究了Pt颗粒大小等性质如何影响Pt/SBA-15催化剂在丙烷脱氢中的性能。它表明,通过沉淀-沉积法制备的Pt/SBA-15_DP催化剂中Pt颗粒远小于通过湿法浸渍法制备的Pt/SBA-15_WI。
