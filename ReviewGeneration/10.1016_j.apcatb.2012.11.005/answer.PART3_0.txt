<quotes>
[1] Deposition of Pt particles on SBA-15 can be conducted by three strategies: (1) the Pt ions in solution were first adsorbed on the SBA-15, and then reduced to metallic Pt by reducing agent such as H2 or NaBH4; (2) the Pt ions were first reduced to metallic Pt and then deposited on SBA-15; and (3) in situ incorporation of Pt colloids to the framework during the SBA-15 synthesis process. 
[2] In the preparation of Pt/SBA-15, the most commonly used strategy is to deposit them on high-surface-area supports, with the aim to improve the Pt dispersion and obtain nano-sized Pt particles
