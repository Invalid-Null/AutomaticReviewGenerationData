[1] Deposition of Pt particles on SBA-15 can be conducted by three strategies: (1) the Pt ions in solution were first adsorbed on the SBA-15, and then reduced to metallic Pt by reducing agent such as H2 or NaBH4; (2) the Pt ions were first reduced to metallic Pt and then deposited on SBA-15; and (3) in situ incorporation of Pt colloids to the framework during the SBA-15 synthesis process. 
[2] In the preparation of Pt/SBA-15, the most commonly used strategy is to deposit them on high-surface-area supports, with the aim to improve the Pt dispersion and obtain nano-sized Pt particles

 Unfortunately, there are no relevant quotes to answer any of the questions. The literature does not describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports or evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports. It focuses on the preparation of Pt nanoparticles supported on mesoporous silica SBA-15 by various methods like wetness impregnation, deposition-precipitation, graft hybrid, colloid immobilization, and nanoparticle encapsulation. The article investigates catalyst preparation aimed at optimizing Pt dispersion on the SBA-15 support, but does not utilize in-situ techniques to study propane dehydrogenation catalysts specifically. It also does not employ advanced microscopy or X-ray based techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces or oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation. Different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation are not evaluated.
