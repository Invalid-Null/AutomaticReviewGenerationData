<English version answer>
1. No, the article does not describe techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. It focuses on studying the binding of perfluorinated compounds to human liver fatty acid binding protein.

2. No, the article does not evaluate metal encapsulation in zeolite supports. It investigates the interaction between perfluorinated compounds and a human protein.  

3. No, the article does not investigate catalyst preparation methods. It studies the binding affinity between perfluorinated chemicals and a fatty acid transport protein.

4. No, the article does not utilize any in-situ characterization techniques to study propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It examines the binding of perfluorinated compounds with a human protein using fluorescence and CD spectroscopy.  

5. No, the article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces. It uses computational modeling to analyze the interaction of perfluorinated chemicals inside the binding site of a human protein.

6. No, the article does not use X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It focuses entirely on the binding of perfluorinated compounds to a human fatty acid binding protein.

7. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation. It studies the molecular interaction between perfluorinated compounds and a human protein using fluorescence spectroscopy and computational modeling.
