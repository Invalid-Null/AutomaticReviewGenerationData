 Unfortunately, this literature does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or related topics. It is about the binding interactions between perfluorinated compounds and human liver fatty acid binding protein. Therefore, I cannot provide relevant quotes or answers to the questions asked which are all related to propane dehydrogenation. My apologies for not being helpful here.
