     [1] "SiO2-supported Ru2P and RuP phases were prepared by composition turning by the P content with H3PO4 as the phosphorus source, and the structural evolution was confirmed by XPS, EXAFS, and HAADF-STEM analysis, allowing for the evaluation of the influence of surface composition on the catalytic properties."
     
     [2] "SiO2 (Davisil Grade 646 silica gel, Sigma-Aldrich, 3560 mesh, pore volume 1.15 cm3/g)-supported Ru-P containing 2 wt % Ru with P/Ru molar ratios of 1:1, 5:1, 15:1, and 50:1 was prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation method."
     
     [3] "The particle size distribution of the reduced catalysts was determined using JEOL-2100F TEM at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV."
     
     [4] "The histograms show that all four Ru-P/SiO2 catalysts have a narrow size distribution from 2 to 4 nm, and the mean size of Ru-P/SiO2-1, Ru-P/SiO2-5, Ru-P/SiO2-15, and Ru-P/SiO2-50 particles is ∼3.1, 2.9, 3.0, and 2.8 nm, respectively."
     
     [5] "The Ru-P particle sizes are similar...allow for comparison of the catalytic performance resulting from changes in surface structure."

     [1] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on the reduced catalysts...The Ru 3d5/2 peak in the Ru/SiO2 catalyst is at 279.1 eV, consistent with metallic Ru."
     
     [2] "The Ru K-edge (22117.0 eV) XAS spectra were collected at the Ru edge are shown in Figure 3A and Figure S3 (Ru-P/SiO2-5)"
     
     [3] "X-ray absorption (XANES and EXAFS) spectra were collected at the Ru K-edge (22117.0 eV) on reduced Ru and Ru-P catalysts."
     
     [4] "The XANES spectra indicate that all catalysts have metallic Ru since the edge energy and white line intensities are similar to that for Ru foil."
     
     [5] "For Ru-P catalysts, the edge energy further increases with increasing P:Ru atomic ratio from 1 to 50 and are 22117.3, 22117.5, 22117.7 and 22117.8 eV. This increase in energy and change in the shape of the XANES with the introduction of P to metallic Ru suggests the formation of Ru phosphide NPs."
