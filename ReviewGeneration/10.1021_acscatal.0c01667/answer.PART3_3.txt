[1] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, transmission CO-IR of the reduced catalyst, and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy are used to identify the surface structure of NPs with different P/Ru atomic ratios, changing from Ru to Ru2P to RuP with increasing P loading."

[2] "The XANES spectra indicate that all catalysts have metallic Ru since the edge energy and white line intensities are similar to that for Ru foil. (37) Ru foil has an edge energy of 22117.0 eV, and the XANES energy of monometallic Ru NPs increases slightly to 22117.2 eV. For Ru-P catalysts, the edge energy further increases with increasing P:Ru atomic ratio from 1 to 50 and are 22117.3, 22117.5, 22117.7 and 22117.8 eV. This increase in energy and change in the shape of the XANES with the introduction of P to metallic Ru suggests the formation of Ru phosphide NPs. (11)"
