Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question’s section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

 Here are the relevant quotes and answers:
<quotes>

[1] "As dehydrogenation is highly endothermic, PDH requires high reaction temperature (550650C), where hydrogenolysis and coke formation are also favored."

[2] "Because of the increased availability of U.S. shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become increasingly important for the production of propylene, which is one of the largest petrochemicals."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

1. The article provides background that propylene is a major petrochemical produced through propane dehydrogenation. It states that PDH requires high temperatures of 550-650°C where undesirable hydrogenolysis and coking reactions also occur.

</English version answer>

 Unfortunately this literature does not contain enough relevant information to answer the questions posed. The article is focused on introducing a new Ru-P catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and does not provide substantial background on the reaction itself, mechanisms, prior work, thermodynamics, kinetics, computational studies, microkinetic modeling, or structure-activity relationships. Since no relevant quotes could be extracted, I will respond to each question directly:
