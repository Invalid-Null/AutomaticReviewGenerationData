 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that directly address the questions asked. The article focuses on evaluating metal phosphide catalysts, specifically Ru-P, for propane dehydrogenation. It does not evaluate metal oxide or supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt or Pd. The article also does not investigate the effects of properties like oxidation state, oxygen mobility, particle size, or shape on the performance of the catalysts. No mechanistic reaction pathways are proposed for propane dehydrogenation over the studied catalysts. The article is solely focused on systematically tuning the composition and structure of Ru-P nanoparticles by altering the P/Ru ratio and correlating the changes observed through various characterization techniques to the resulting propane dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.
