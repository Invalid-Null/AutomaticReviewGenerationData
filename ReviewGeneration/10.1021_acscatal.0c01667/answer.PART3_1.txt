[1] "SiO2 (Davisil Grade 646 silica gel, Sigma-Aldrich, 3560 mesh, pore volume 1.15 cm3/g)-supported Ru-P containing 2 wt % Ru with P/Ru molar ratios of 1:1, 5:1, 15:1, and 50:1 was prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation method."

[2] "The particle size distribution of the reduced catalysts was determined using JEOL-2100F TEM at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV." 

[3] "The histograms show that all four Ru-P/SiO2 catalysts have a narrow size distribution from 2 to 4 nm, and the mean size of Ru-P/SiO2-1, Ru-P/SiO2-5, Ru-P/SiO2-15, and Ru-P/SiO2-50 particles is ∼3.1, 2.9, 3.0, and 2.8 nm, respectively."

[4] "The similar Ru-P particle sizes allow for comparison of the catalytic performance resulting from changes in surface structure."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It prepares SiO2-supported Ru-P catalysts with different P/Ru ratios using incipient wetness impregnation. TEM analysis shows the resulting Ru-P nanoparticles have narrow size distributions of 2-4 nm, allowing comparison of catalytic performance.

[1] "Additional evidence for the Ru-P NP structures was determined by high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) for Ru-P/SiO2-15 and Ru-P/SiO2-50. Representative micrographs are shown in Figure 5."

[2] "In Figure 5a, the Ru-P/SiO2-15 sample shows a lattice spacing of 0.236 nm consistent with the Ru2P (210) crystallographic orientation (JCPDS 65-2382). Figure 5b,c depicts lattice fringes with lattice spacing of 0.251 and 0.204 nm, corresponding to (111) and (112) crystal planes of RuP." 

[3] "These results indicate the formation of nanocrystalline Ru2P and RuP on SiO2 with 15 and 50 P/Ru, respectively."

[1] "The chemical states of phosphorus were also investigated, and the P 2 s XP spectrum was shown in Figure S2. With respect to the Ru-P/SiO2-1 sample, the BE at 189.7 eV (minor peak) and 192.2 eV (major peak) are assigned to the P (0) and P (V) species, respectively."

[2] "X-ray absorption (XANES and EXAFS) spectra were collected at the Ru K-edge (22117.0 eV) on reduced Ru and Ru-P catalysts." 

[3] "The XANES spectra indicate that all catalysts have metallic Ru since the edge energy and white line intensities are similar to that for Ru foil."

[4] "For Ru-P catalysts, the edge energy further increases with increasing P:Ru atomic ratio from 1 to 50 and are 22117.3, 22117.5, 22117.7 and 22117.8 eV. This increase in energy and change in the shape of the XANES with the introduction of P to metallic Ru suggests the formation of Ru phosphide NPs."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS) to probe oxidation state changes at the Ru K-edge during synthesis of Ru-P nanoparticles. It shows an increase in Ru edge energy with increasing P content, suggesting formation of Ru phosphide phases.
