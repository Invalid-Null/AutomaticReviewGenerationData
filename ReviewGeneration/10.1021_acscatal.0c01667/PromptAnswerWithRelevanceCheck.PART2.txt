<quotes>
[1] "Similar to Pt3V, in a PtZn intermetallic alloy, the XANES energy, that is, the energy of the unfilled orbitals, increased, which was accompanied by an identical decrease in the energy of the filled 5d orbitals measured by RIXS. (18)"

[2] "These changes increase with an increasing P:Ru atomic ratio and also correlate with the increased TORs. By lowering the energy of the Ru 4d orbitals, Ru-alkene bonds are weakened, resulting in lower surface coverage. (60,61)"
</quotes>

<English version answer>
3. Yes, the paper investigates electronic and geometric effects of phosphorus in the bimetallic Ru-P catalysts. It shows that increasing P content weakens Ru-alkene bonds by lowering the energy of Ru 4d orbitals, resulting in lower surface coverage and higher turnover rates. The isolated Ru sites in RuP also limit the formation of Ru ensembles needed for hydrogenolysis.

<quotes>
[1] "The Ru ensembles are shown by the dotted yellow lines in Figure 11, and Ru NPs ensembles consist of seven Ru atoms, or more. In Ru2P, the Ru ensemble size is smaller, and each Ru atom has four adjacent Ru atoms exposed on a (210) facet." 

[2] "Once a Ru2P NP is formed, on the Ru2P (210) surface, the Ru-Ru ensembles comprise four Ru atoms, hydrogenolysis is inhibited, and propylene selectivity increases to 77% (at 25% conversion)."
</quotes>

<English version answer> 
5. Yes, the paper describes synergistic ensemble effects between Ru and P in the bimetallic catalysts. It shows smaller Ru ensembles in Ru2P limit hydrogenolysis compared to larger Ru ensembles in monometallic Ru NPs, resulting in higher propylene selectivity.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
5. 是的,该论文描述了二金属催化剂中Ru和P之间的协同集合效应。它表明,与单金属Ru纳米粒子中的较大Ru集合体相比,Ru2P中的较小Ru集合体限制了氢解,从而提高了丙烯选择性。

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of phosphorus as the secondary metal in Ru-P bimetallic phosphide catalysts. It shows that increasing P content isolates the Ru sites, decreasing ensemble size, which suppresses hydrogenolysis selectivity.

[1] "In Ru2P, the Ru ensemble size is smaller, and each Ru atom has four adjacent Ru atoms exposed on a (210) facet. In addition, the Ru-Ru bond distance is longer than that in metallic Ru."

[2] "Further increasing the P content, that is, in RuP, leads to complete isolation of contiguous Ru atoms by P atoms." 

[3] "Once a Ru2P NP is formed, on the Ru2P (210) surface, the Ru-Ru ensembles comprise four Ru atoms, hydrogenolysis is inhibited, and propylene selectivity increases to 77% (at 25% conversion)."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of phosphorus as a secondary metal in the Ru-P bimetallic catalysts. It shows that increasing P content reduces the size of Ru ensembles and isolates Ru atoms, which suppresses hydrogenolysis and increases propylene selectivity. The Ru-Ru bond distance also increases with more P.

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article describes synergistic ensemble and ligand effects between Ru and P in the bimetallic catalysts. It shows that increasing P content isolates the Ru atoms and reduces the Ru ensemble size, which suppresses hydrogenolysis and increases propylene selectivity. This is attributed to weaker Ru-adsorbate bonds from ligand effects with more P neighbors.

答:是的,本文描述了双金属催化剂中Ru和P之间的协同配体和集合效应。它显示P含量的增加隔离了Ru原子并减小了Ru聚集体的大小,抑制了氢裂解并提高了丙烯选择性。这归因于与更多的P相邻原子带来的配体效应弱化了Ru-吸附物键。

<quotes>
[1] "In addition to improving the olefin selectivity, increasing the P/Ru ratio leads to higher turnover rates and lowers the deactivation rate. P is thought to act as a structural promoter to reduce the Ru ensemble size, decreasing the hydrogenolysis rate."

[2] "For Group 8 transition metals, the chemical properties are determined by the energy of the filled d orbitals, for example, 4d orbitals in Ru. As shown in Figures 2 and 3A, the formation of the Ru-P bond affects the XPS and XANES spectra, resulting in a shift to higher 3d binding energy and K-edge XANES (1 s to 5p transition) of the Ru."

[3] "Although these are not the energy of the Ru 4d valence orbitals, a recent study of Pt3V intermetallic alloys showed that an increase in the Pt 4f XPS binding energy and L3-edge XANES energy correlated with a decrease energy of the Pt-filled 5d orbitals determined by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS)." 

</quotes>

<English version answer>
3. Yes, the article investigates both electronic and geometric effects of phosphorus addition in the Ru-P bimetallic catalysts. It shows that increasing P content reduces the Ru ensemble size, which decreases hydrogenolysis (geometric effect). It also shows that Ru-P bond formation shifts Ru XPS and XANES spectra to higher energies, suggesting a decrease in Ru 4d orbital energies that weakens metal-adsorbate bonds (electronic effect).

5. Yes, the article describes synergistic ensemble and ligand effects between Ru and P in the bimetallic Ru-P catalysts.
