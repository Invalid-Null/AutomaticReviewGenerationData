         [1] "In addition to improving the olefin selectivity, increasing the P/Ru ratio leads to higher turnover rates and lowers the deactivation rate. P is thought to act as a structural promoter to reduce the Ru ensemble size, decreasing the hydrogenolysis rate."
         [2] "For Group 8 transition metals, the chemical properties are determined by the energy of the filled d orbitals, for example, 4d orbitals in Ru. As shown in Figures 2 and 3A, the formation of the Ru-P bond affects the XPS and XANES spectra, resulting in a shift to higher 3d binding energy and K-edge XANES (1 s to 5p transition) of the Ru." 
         [3] "Although these are not the energy of the Ru 4d valence orbitals, a recent study of Pt3V intermetallic alloys showed that an increase in the Pt 4f XPS binding energy and L3-edge XANES energy correlated with a decrease energy of the Pt-filled 5d orbitals determined by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS)."

         Yes, the article investigates both electronic and geometric effects of phosphorus addition in the Ru-P bimetallic catalysts. It shows that increasing P content reduces the Ru ensemble size, which decreases hydrogenolysis (geometric effect). It also shows that Ru-P bond formation shifts Ru XPS and XANES spectra to higher energies, suggesting a decrease in Ru 4d orbital energies that weakens metal-adsorbate bonds (electronic effect).

         是的,该文研究了磷添加对Ru-P双金属催化剂的电子效应和几何效应。表明P含量的增加减小了Ru团簇大小,从而降低了氢化裂解反应(几何效应)。它还表明Ru-P键的形成使Ru XPS和XANES光谱向更高的能量位移,提示Ru 4d轨道能量降低,弱化了金属-吸附剂键(电子效应)。

        [1] "The Ru ensemble size is smaller, and each Ru atom has four adjacent Ru atoms exposed on a (210) facet. In addition, the Ru-Ru bond distance is longer than that in metallic Ru. Further increasing the P content, that is, in RuP, leads to complete isolation of contiguous Ru atoms by P atoms."
        [2] "The specific composition and surface structures also correlate with their catalytic performance. Since hydrogenolysis and coke formation are sensitive to the surface structure, the decrease in the Ru ensemble size significantly reduces the hydrogenolysis rate."

         Yes, the article describes synergistic ensemble and ligand effects between Ru and P in the bimetallic Ru-P catalysts. It shows that increasing P content reduces the Ru ensemble size and isolates Ru atoms (ensemble effect), which decreases hydrogenolysis. It also indicates that longer Ru-Ru bonds in Ru-P versus Ru weaken metal-adsorbate interactions (ligand effect), improving selectivity.

         是的,该文描述了Ru-P双金属催化剂中Ru和P之间的协同配位和配体效应。它表明P含量的增加减小了Ru团簇大小并隔离了Ru原子(配位效应),这降低了氢化裂解反应。它还提示Ru-P中的Ru-Ru键比Ru中的键更长,削弱了金属-吸附剂相互作用(配体效应),提高了选择性。
