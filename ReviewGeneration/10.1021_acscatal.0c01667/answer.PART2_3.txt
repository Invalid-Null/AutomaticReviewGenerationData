<quotes>
[1] "In Ru2P, the Ru ensemble size is smaller, and each Ru atom has four adjacent Ru atoms exposed on a (210) facet. In addition, the Ru-Ru bond distance is longer than that in metallic Ru."

[2] "Further increasing the P content, that is, in RuP, leads to complete isolation of contiguous Ru atoms by P atoms." 

[3] "Once a Ru2P NP is formed, on the Ru2P (210) surface, the Ru-Ru ensembles comprise four Ru atoms, hydrogenolysis is inhibited, and propylene selectivity increases to 77% (at 25% conversion)."

[4] "Further isolation of Ru by P in RuP leads to further suppression of the hydrogenolysis rate and a propylene selectivity of 91%."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of phosphorus as a secondary metal in the Ru-P bimetallic catalysts. It shows that increasing P content reduces the size of Ru ensembles and isolates Ru atoms, which suppresses hydrogenolysis and increases propylene selectivity. The Ru-Ru bond distance also increases with more P.

答:是的,本文研究了磷作为Ru-P双金属催化剂中的次要金属的电子和几何效应。它显示磷含量的增加减小了Ru聚集体的大小,隔离了Ru原子,抑制了氢裂解,提高了丙烯选择性。Ru-Ru键长与磷含量的增加也有关。

Answer: No, the article does not explore the use of subsurface promoters like Re or Mn in the bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It only studies the effects of phosphorus addition.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:没有,本文没有探讨像Re或Mn等亚表面促进剂在双金属和合金催化剂中的使用。它仅研究了磷的添加效应。

[1] "The Ru ensembles are shown by the dotted yellow lines in Figure 11, and Ru NPs ensembles consist of seven Ru atoms, or more. In Ru2P, the Ru ensemble size is smaller, and each Ru atom has four adjacent Ru atoms exposed on a (210) facet."

[2] "Further increasing the P content, that is, in RuP, leads to complete isolation of contiguous Ru atoms by P atoms."

[3] "Once a Ru2P NP is formed, on the Ru2P (210) surface, the Ru-Ru ensembles comprise four Ru atoms, hydrogenolysis is inhibited, and propylene selectivity increases to 77% (at 25% conversion)." 

[4] "Further isolation of Ru by P in RuP leads to further suppression of the hydrogenolysis rate and a propylene selectivity of 91%."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article describes synergistic ensemble and ligand effects between Ru and P in the bimetallic catalysts. It shows that increasing P content isolates the Ru atoms and reduces the Ru ensemble size, which suppresses hydrogenolysis and increases propylene selectivity. This is attributed to weaker Ru-adsorbate bonds from ligand effects with more P neighbors.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文描述了双金属催化剂中Ru和P之间的协同配体和集合效应。它显示P含量的增加隔离了Ru原子并减小了Ru聚集体的大小,抑制了氢裂解并提高了丙烯选择性。这归因于与更多的P相邻原子带来的配体效应弱化了Ru-吸附物键。
