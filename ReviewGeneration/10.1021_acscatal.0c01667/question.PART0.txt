Composition Tuning of Ru-Based Phosphide for Enhanced Propane Selective Dehydrogenation
Abstract
In this work, we report a robust Ru phosphide (RuP) catalyst, which exhibits high propylene selectivity for propane dehydrogenation, whereas monometallic Ru nanoparticles (NPs) result in cracking. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, transmission CO-IR of the reduced catalyst, and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy are used to identify the surface structure of NPs with different P/Ru atomic ratios, changing from Ru to Ru2P to RuP with increasing P loading. In addition to improving the olefin selectivity, increasing the P/Ru ratio leads to higher turnover rates and lowers the deactivation rate. P is thought to act as a structural promoter to reduce the Ru ensemble size, decreasing the hydrogenolysis rate. In addition, increasing the P/Ru ratio leads to a decrease in the energy of the Ru valence orbitals, which are suggested to weaken metal-adsorbate bond energies and reactant surface coverages.

KEYWORDS:Ru catalyst metal phosphide propane dehydrogenation geometric effect catalytic stability
1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Because of the increased availability of U.S. shale gas, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become increasingly important for the production of propylene, which is one of the largest petrochemicals. (1,2) As dehydrogenation is highly endothermic, PDH requires high reaction temperature (550650C), where hydrogenolysis and coke formation are also favored. (36) Fortunately, these pathways occur on separate active sites, single atoms for dehydrogenation and multiatom ensembles for hydrogenolysis. Thus, high olefin yields can be obtained by careful catalyst design. Bimetallic nanoparticle (NP) catalysts can offer one approach to fine-tune surface properties and catalytic selectivity via simply altering the active sites. For example, although Pt is considered the most active and olefin-selective monometallic Group 8 catalyst, (7) its intrinsic olefin selectivity and stability are insufficient for practical applications. Promoter addition, affording bimetallic catalysts such as Pt-Sn, Pt-Cr, Pt-Ga, Pt-Cu, Pt-Co, Pt-In, and PtGa-Pb, (814) leads to higher olefin selectivity and lower coke formation by reducing the size of Pt ensembles and changing the energy of the Pt valence orbitals. (1518)
Thus, modification of the surface structure of NPs offers a way to turn a stone into gold, perhaps even for ruthenium (Ru) NPs, which is seldom considered for the PDH because of its high hydrogenolysis selectivity. (19,20) Recently, however, Chi and co-workers (21) used density functional theory calculations to demonstrate that Ru-phthalocyanine, possessing isolated Ru sites, is a potentially attractive catalyst for PDH. Its high alkene selectivity was attributed to weak Ru-olefin bonds. Ru has also attracted attention as an effective anti-coke component for steam reforming of methane. Because of the price of Ru is lower than Pt, (22) an effective Ru catalyst could be an attractive alternative for PDH or other catalytic reactions. However, Ru is a 4d transition metal and generally adopts a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure; therefore, the synthesis of Ru alloy catalysts with common face-centered cubic structure transition metals is not expected.
Incorporation of nonmetallic heteroatoms into Group 8 metal NPs, such as phosphorous to form transition metal phosphides (TMPs), has also been shown to be an effective method for tailoring the electronic and surface structures. (2327) TMPs also offer additional flexibility for tuning their properties because of the formation of multiple phases. For PDH, Ni and Fe TMPs have shown improved olefin selectivity compared with monometallic NPs. (28,29) Although these TMP compounds have metallic character, there was no fundamental understanding of the role of P heteroatoms in altering the catalytic performance. Such insight could provide design principles for the rational design of improved catalysts.
Herein, a series of 3 nm Ru-P NPs supported on silica with P/Ru molar ratios of 1, 5, 15, and 50 were prepared to explore the composition and structure of Ru-P/SiO2 catalysts and the effect on catalytic performance. Monometallic Ru and Pt catalysts were also synthesized for comparison. Their structure, surface composition, and properties were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) absorption spectroscopy of adsorbed CO, and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). Propane dehydrogenation was used to evaluate the effect of P on catalytic performance.

2.1. Catalyst Synthesis
SiO2 (Davisil Grade 646 silica gel, Sigma-Aldrich, 3560 mesh, pore volume 1.15 cm3/g)-supported Ru-P containing 2 wt % Ru with P/Ru molar ratios of 1:1, 5:1, 15:1, and 50:1 was prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation method. The Ru-P/SiO2 sample names were based on their target P/Ru molar ratios. All catalysts were made by a similar procedure. For example, Ru-P/SiO2-50 was prepared by dissolving 3.3 mL phosphoric acid (85% H3PO4) in 2.5 mL of deionized water, which was added to 5 g of SiO2, dried at 125 C, and calcined at 250 C for 3 h. Hexaammineruthenium (III) chloride (0.3126 g) (Ru(NH3)6·Cl3; Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 5.8 mL of deionized water and was added drop-wise to the P/SiO2. The catalyst was dried, calcined for 3 h at 300C, and reduced at 600C in 5% H2 for 3 h. The Ru-P/SiO2-1, Ru-P/SiO2-5, and Ru-P/SiO2-15 samples were prepared by the same method except for the different amounts of the P precursor. Monometallic Pt/SiO2 and Ru/SiO2 catalysts with 2 wt % metal loading were synthesized using a similar method.
2.2. Characterizations
The particle size distribution of the reduced catalysts was determined using JEOL-2100F TEM at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. In addition, HAADF-STEM was performed on an FEI Titan Themis microscope field with aberration-corrected lens, operating at 300 kV for Ru-P/SiO2-15 and Ru-P/SiO2-50 samples.
XPS spectra were obtained using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer and charge neutralizer with Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) at an energy pass of 20 and 160 eV. Catalysts were reduced in an attached treatment chamber and transferred in vacuum to avoid oxidation by air.
The Ru K-edge (22,117 eV) XAS spectra were obtained in transmission mode on reduced catalysts at the bending magnet (10 BM) and insertion device beamlines (10-ID), at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The catalysts were reduced at 600C for 0.5 h in 5.0% H2/He. The samples were purged with He, and the data were collected at RT. Standard procedures were used to analyze the XAS spectra using WinXAS 3.1 software. (30) Least-squared fits of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were obtained in r-space, and optimization of the DebyeWaller factor, that is, Δσ, (2) was performed on isolated k2-weighted EXAFS in k-space. Experimental phase and amplitude functions were obtained for Ru-Ru and Ru-P scattering paths, from Ru foil and Na2PdCl4, respectively.
Transmission FTIR spectra of the reduced catalyst were collected on a Bruker Tensor 27 instrument with a MCT detector. Pressed samples were reduced with 5% H2/He at 600C for 30 min and cooled in He flow. Reduced catalysts were treated with flowing CO for 30 min, purged with He, and 64 scans were collected at 30C from 25001500 cm1.
CO chemisorption was determined using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 chemisorption equipment. Approximately, 100 mg of sample was reduced at 600C in 5% H2/He (50 mL/min), and the CO chemisorption capacity was determined at 30C.
2.3. Catalyst Evaluation
Propane dehydrogenation was conducted in a fixed-bed, plug-flow, quartz tube (3/8 in. OD) reactor. Catalyst (50 to 500 mg) was diluted with 1 g silica to vary the propane conversion. The catalysts were prereduced at 600C and cooled to 550 or 600C to determine the catalyst performance. The gas composition was 2.5% C3H8, 2.5% H2 (balance N2), and the flow rate was controlled with mass flow controllers. Propane, propylene, methane, ethane, and ethylene were determined by online gas chromatography (Agilent 6890) coupled to an FID detector with a Restek Rt-Alumina BOND/Na2SO4 GC column (30 m, 0.32 mm ID, and 0.5 μm film thickness). The propane conversion and propylene selectivity were determined from the equations below.
A first-order model was used to determine the deactivation rate constant. (31,32)
Conv0 and Conv2 are the initial and final conversions, respectively, t is the duration of the experiment (2 h), and kd is the deactivation constant (h1).
The apparent activation energy (Ea) was determined by Arrhenius plots below 15% propane conversion at each reaction temperature.

3.1. Transmission Electron Microscopy
Catalysts with 2 wt % Ru loading and different P:Ru ratios were synthesized by the pH-modified impregnation. Representative TEM particle size distributions are shown in Figure 1 for Ru-P series catalysts after reduction at 600C. More than 300 particles were randomly selected to determine the distribution and mean size of metal NPs. The histograms show that all four Ru-P/SiO2 catalysts have a narrow size distribution from 2 to 4 nm, and the mean size of Ru-P/SiO2-1, Ru-P/SiO2-5, Ru-P/SiO2-15, and Ru-P/SiO2-50 particles is  3.1, 2.9, 3.0, and 2.8 nm, respectively. The similar Ru-P particle sizes allow for comparison of the catalytic performance resulting from changes in surface structure. The monometallic Ru/SiO2, as a comparison, exhibits wider size distribution (28 nm) and larger average particle size, (4.5 nm), as shown in Figure S1.

3.2. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
Detailed elemental compositions and valence states of the Ru-P samples with different P:Ru ratios were investigated using XPS on the reduced catalysts. As shown in Figure 2, Ru 3d3/2 and Ru 3d5/2 peaks overlap with C 1s peak; therefore, the spectra were calibrated by setting the Si 2p peak to a binding energy of 103.5 eV. (33) The background was subtracted using a Shirley line shape, the curve fitting was performed using the Lorentzian asymmetric line shape with tail damping, and the C 1s component was fixed at 284.2  0.2 eV for all the spectra. (34) The three components of the monometallic Ru/SiO2 catalyst are assigned to Ru 3d3/2, Ru 3d5/2, and C1s. (33) The Ru 3d5/2 peak in the Ru/SiO2 catalyst is at 279.1 eV, consistent with metallic Ru. (35) The same three components fit well with the data of Ru-P/SiO2-15 and Ru-P/SiO2-50 catalysts, with the peak positions of Ru 3d5/2 at 280.2 and 281.0 eV, respectively, suggesting that they form pure but different phosphide phases. (36) As for Ru-P/SiO2-1 and Ru-P/SiO2-5, the fitted spectra show the coexistence of two different Ru species, one at 278.9  279.1 eV, which is assigned to metallic Ru, whereas the other at 281.2 eV, which is consistent with the Ruδ+ species. (37) The percentages of Ruδ+ species in Ru-P/SiO2-1 and Ru-P/SiO2-5 catalysts are 12% and 15%, respectively. Comparison of all these catalysts indicates that there is an increase in the Ru binding energy with increasing P content of the catalyst, which will be shown below to correlate with increasing P content in the NPs. The chemical states of phosphorus were also investigated, and the P 2 s XP spectrum was shown in Figure S2. With respect to the Ru-P/SiO2-1 sample, the BE at 189.7 eV (minor peak) and 192.2 eV (major peak) are assigned to the P (0) and P (V) species, respectively, whereas only P (V) species can be detected with increasing P/Ru ratios because of excess P loading. (38) Thus, most of the P is on the support and present as P(V) oxide.

3.3. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
The X-ray absorption (XANES and EXAFS) spectra were collected at the Ru K-edge (22117.0 eV) on reduced Ru and Ru-P catalysts. The XANES spectra at the Ru edge are shown in Figure 3A and Figure S3 (Ru-P/SiO2-5), and the edge energies are listed in Table 1. The XANES spectra indicate that all catalysts have metallic Ru since the edge energy and white line intensities are similar to that for Ru foil. (37) Ru foil has an edge energy of 22117.0 eV, and the XANES energy of monometallic Ru NPs increases slightly to 22117.2 eV. For Ru-P catalysts, the edge energy further increases with increasing P:Ru atomic ratio from 1 to 50 and are 22117.3, 22117.5, 22117.7 and 22117.8 eV. This increase in energy and change in the shape of the XANES with the introduction of P to metallic Ru suggests the formation of Ru phosphide NPs. (11)

Figure 3B shows the Ru K-edge k2-weighted magnitude of Fourier transform (FT) of the EXAFS for monometallic Ru and Ru-P catalysts. The first shell magnitude of the FT of Ru/SiO2 has two peaks, similar in position to those in Ru foil, with one large peak at about 2.5 Å and a smaller peak at about 2 Å. The four Ru-P samples give EXAFS with very different shapes. A satisfactory fit of the EXAFS was obtained by including Ru-Ru and Ru-P scattering pairs. The model fits of monometallic Ru/SiO2 and Ru-P/SiO2 with different P:Ru ratios are presented in Figure S4. For Ru-P/SiO2-1 with low P:Ru atomic ratio, good fits were obtained with a Ru-Ru distance of 2.69 Å and coordination number of 8.5 and a Ru-P distance of 2.30 Å and coordination number of 1.3. The Ru-P/SiO2-1 catalyst has a ratio of Ru-P to Ru-Ru of 0.15, suggesting that the coordination environment of Ru is mainly neighboring Ru atoms. The EXAFS fits are also consistent with the percentage of Ru0 and Ruδ+ species calculated from XPS. With increasing content of P, the k2-weighted magnitude of the FT shows an increased intensity in the Ru-P peak, at about 1.7 Å, and a decreased intensity of the Ru-Ru peaks, Figure 3B. The fits, given in Table 1, indicate that the Ru-P to Ru-Ru coordination number ratio (CNRu-P/CNRu-Ru) increases to 0.31, 0.48, and, finally, 1.0 for Ru-P/SiO2-5, Ru-P/SiO2-15, and Ru-P/SiO2-50, respectively. In addition, the Ru-Ru bond distance increases to 2.84 Å in Ru-P/SiO2-15 and Ru-P/SiO2-50, which is significantly longer than that in the monometallic Ru. Normally, it is difficult to identify the resulting metal phosphide structure by EXAFS, especially because multiple phases may be formed, for example, coreshell, solid solution, or intermetallic compound. By XPS, in addition to Ru, two Ru phosphide phases were observed. There are two thermodynamically stable phases of Ru-P intermetallic compounds reported in the inorganic crystal structure database that fit these results. The Ru phosphide phases Ru2P and RuP adopt orthorhombic unit cells based on the Pnma space group. (39) The Ru2P crystal structure belongs to the anti-PbCl2 structure type, whereas the RuP belongs to the MnP structure type. The unit cells for Ru2P and RuP are shown in Figure 4. Similar to many metal phosphides, in Ru2P and RuP, P atoms are coordinated in a triangular prismatic geometry (Figure 4). (40,41) A Ru-Ru EXAFS distance of 2.84 Å and Ru-P distance at 2.22 Å with 0.5 of the CNRu-P/CNRu-Ru ratio in the Ru-P/SiO2-15 is consistent with the formation of Ru2P. For Ru-P/SiO2-50, the Ru-Ru and Ru-P distances are also 2.84 and 2.22 Å, respectively; however, the CNRu-P/CNRu-Ru ratio is close to 1.0, which is consistent with RuP.

3.4. High-Resolution Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy
Additional evidence for the Ru-P NP structures was determined by high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) for Ru-P/SiO2-15 and Ru-P/SiO2-50. Representative micrographs are shown in Figure 5. In Figure 5a, the Ru-P/SiO2-15 sample shows a lattice spacing of 0.236 nm consistent with the Ru2P (210) crystallographic orientation (JCPDS 65-2382). Figure 5b,c depicts lattice fringes with lattice spacing of 0.251 and 0.204 nm, corresponding to (111) and (112) crystal planes of RuP. (39) These results indicate the formation of nanocrystalline Ru2P and RuP on SiO2 with 15 and 50 P/Ru, respectively.

3.5. Infrared FT Spectroscopy of CO Chemisorption
The room-temperature IR spectra of CO on the reduced Ru-P catalysts are shown in Figure 6. There are three main features in the spectra. (4244) From high to low wavenumber, these peaks can be attributed to linearly adsorbed CO on Ruδ+ (Ruδ+-CO), linearly adsorbed CO on isolated Ru0 atoms (Ru-CO), and bridge-bonded CO (Ru2-(CO)). (45,46) Specifically, the vibrational peak near 2000 cm1 is reasonably ascribed to bridge-bonded CO, which is strongly adsorbed on the surface of Ru/SiO2 and Ru-P/SiO2-1 samples. As P loading increases, the band at 1998 cm1 undergoes a sharp decrease in intensity in Ru-P/SiO2-5 and disappears completely on Ru-P/SiO215 and Ru-P/SiO2-50, suggesting that the ensembles of Ru adsorption sites are no longer present. Compared with monometallic Ru, a new broad peak between 2150 and 2050 cm1 emerges, indicating that cationic Ruδ+-carbonyl species forms with the addition of phosphorus. The CO band assigned to Ruδ+-carbonyl is shifted to lower frequency than gas-phase CO (2167 cm1) because of Ru d-electron back-donation to the CO π* antibonding orbital. (47) Furthermore, the intensity of Ruδ+-carbonyl peak increases with increasing P content from 5 to 50, suggesting weaker CO binding to Ru with increasing P content, consistent with XPS and XANES results.

3.6. Catalytic Performance
The rates and selectivity for PDH for monometallic Ru, Pt and Ru phosphide catalysts were determined with 2.5% C3H8, 2.5% H2 with balanced N2 at 600C after pre-reduction at 600C. With increasing hydrogen-to-hydrocarbon ratio, the hydrogenolysis rate increases, lowering the olefin selectivity and is, therefore, a more severe evaluation of the selectivity performance. The PDH products were propylene with minor amounts of methane, ethane, and ethylene.
The propylene selectivity extrapolated to zero time on stream, that is, coke free selectivity, of the catalysts up to about 25% conversion is shown in Figure 7. For Ru/SiO2 at 550C, the propylene selectivity is ca. 71% at about 5% propane conversion but decreases to about 20% at 25% conversion, see also Figure S5. At 600C, the olefin selectivity is even lower, for example, ca. 4.5% of propylene selectivity at 22.5% propane conversion. Similar to other Group 8 metals, higher reaction temperatures favor hydrogenolysis. (48,49)
Figure 7

The Ru-P catalysts improved performance in comparison to the monometallic Ru. As the P content increases, the Ru-P catalysts show higher olefin selectivity (at the same conversion) than the monometallic Ru catalyst. For example, at 550C, the propylene selectivity of Ru-P/SiO2-50 is near 94% from 5% to 25% propane conversion. Although the selectivity of other three Ru-P catalysts are lower, these are much higher than that of Ru. The propylene selectivity at 25% conversion for Ru-P/SiO2-1, Ru-P/SiO2-5, and Ru-P/SiO2-15 is 61.2%, 77.3%, and 83.5%, respectively. At 600C, the olefin selectivities of Ru-P/SiO2-1, Ru-P/SiO2-5, and Ru-P/SiO2-15 are lower than at 550C, although selectivity of Ru-P/SiO2-50 remains high at 91%. The propylene selectivity at 25% propane conversion of Pt, Ru, and Ru phosphide are listed in Table 2, and the Ru-P/SiO2-50 catalyst exhibits superior propylene selectivity compared to Pt/SiO2 and Ru/SiO2.

Because PDH is generally run without added H2, the catalysts were additionally evaluated with a lower ratio of H2/propane. The selectivity at different conversion of Ru and Ru-P/SiO2-50 catalysts is shown in Figure S6. It is clear that decreasing the H2/propane ratio increases the olefin selectivity of both catalysts. The propylene selectivity at 600C at 25% conversion of Ru-P/SiO2-50 and Ru were 94% and 40%, respectively.
To determine the intrinsic rate per surface Ru, the conversion was normalized by the CO chemisorption capacity to give the turnover rate (TOR). The Ru dispersions are summarized in Table 2. The Ru dispersion of Ru/SiO2 and Ru-P/SiO2-1 are about 20%. Further incorporation of P leads to a sharp decrease in the Ru dispersion, 9% for Ru-P/SiO2-5, 6% for Ru-P/SiO2-15, and only 2% for Ru-P/SiO2-50. The initial PDH rate/mole as well as the TORs at 600C are given in Table 2. The Ru/SiO2 catalyst gives a TOR of 0.095 s1, which is less than half that of Pt/SiO2. The addition of P into Ru/SiO2 increases the TOR, for example, 0.165 s1 of Ru-P/SiO2-1. Increasing the P/Ru ratio from 5 to 50 further increases the dehydrogenation TOR from 0.289 to 0.420 s1. For Ru-P/SiO2-50, the PDH TOR was a factor of 4.4 higher than that of Ru/SiO2 and reached 0.42 s1, which is twice that of Pt/SiO2.
The apparent activation energy (Ea) of monometallic Pt and Ru, as well as Ru-P/SiO2-50, was obtained by plotting ln(TOF) versus 1/T, as shown in Figure 8. The apparent activation energy for Pt/SiO2 is 87.3 kJ/mol and is similar to the values previously reported (80100 kJ/mol). (50,51) The Ea of Ru/SiO2 was 128.0 kJ/mol, which is much higher than that of Pt/SiO2, whereas Ea of RuP was 103.9 kJ/mol. The lower activation barrier of the latter would give an increased dehydrogenation TOR compared with Ru NPs.

The first-order deactivation rate constant (kd) was determined to evaluate the catalyst stability. Figure 9A compares the propane conversion versus time over monometallic Ru, Pt, and Ru-P catalysts with an initial propane conversion of 25%. The specific test conditions and the calculated reaction rate at 25% propane conversion are shown in Table S1. For all catalysts, the propane conversion decreases rapidly over the first 20 min followed by a slower rate of decline. Pt/SiO2 has the highest deactivation rate with a kd value of 0.323 h1 at 600C, whereas kd of Ru/SiO2 is lower, 0.202 h1. Although there is a decrease in the initial reaction rate, P addition to Ru clearly improves the deactivation performance. As shown in Figure 9B and Table 2, the deactivation constants decrease with increasing P loading. Ru-P/SiO2-50, that is, RuP, has a kd value of 0.128 h1 at 600C, approximately 40% that of Pt/SiO2. The propylene selectivity of each sample increases for first 30 min, likely because of coking of nonselective hydrogenolysis sites, as shown in Figure S7, and 95% propylene selectivity can be obtained on the Ru-P/SiO2-50 catalyst after 30 min. Furthermore, the RuP phosphide catalyst exhibits good catalytic stability during a 12-h on-stream experiment, as shown in Figure S8. The addition of P to Ru increases the propylene selectivity and stability. RuP NPs have a higher propylene selectivity than that for Ru2P and also have a lower deactivation rate.

4.1. Structure Evolution With Increasing P Loading
The possible structures of TMP NPs include coreshell, solid solution, and intermetallic compounds depending on the composition and synthesis conditions. (9,11,12) The Ru-P catalysts in this study not only have different structures, but these change with increasing P loading. For example, in Ru-P/SiO2-1 and Ru-P/SiO2-5, where the P loading is low, there are two phases: hcp Ru and Ru-P solid solution (12% and 15% phosphide phase, respectively). The CO-IR spectrum of the former is similar to that of Ru NPs, suggesting there is a significant fraction of surface Ru without Ru-P bonds. At slightly higher P loadings, however, EXAFS still indicates a Ru-rich NP, but the IR spectra show that the surface is mostly Ru-P. With further increasing P/Ru ratio, the XPS indicates there are two distinct RuP phases. As the P:Ru synthesis ratio increases from 15 to 50, the EXAFS (Ru-P):(Ru-Ru) CN ratio of the former is 0.5, consistent with Ru2P, whereas the CN ratio of the later is 1.0, consistent with RuP. HR-STEM images are also consistent with Ru2P and RuP. Thus, during the synthesis, as the P loading increases, the Ru-P NPs become increasingly P rich. A representation of these structural changes are shown in Figure 10.

4.2. Geometric Effect and Electronic Effect of Ru-P on Propylene Selectivity and Catalyst Stability
The combination of XPS, XAS, and HAADF-STEM indicates that two pure Ru phosphides (Ru2P and RuP) were formed with increasing P content. Ru NPs have an hcp structure with a Ru-Ru bond distance of 2.75 Å. While a decrease in CNRu-Ru and an increase of CNRu-P is observed simultaneously as the amount of P increases, Ru-P/SiO2-15 has a coordination geometry identical to Ru2P phase, where the average CNRu-P/CNRu-Ru ratio is about 0.5 and the average Ru-Ru distance increases to 2.84 Å. Further increasing the P/Ru ratio to 50, CNRu-Ru/CNRu-P increases to about 1 consistent with RuP. The surface composition and atomic order of NPs are responsible for the catalytic performance, and the most stable surface orientations are (001) for Ru, (210) for Ru2P, and (111) in RuP. (5254) The Ru ensembles are shown by the dotted yellow lines in Figure 11, and Ru NPs ensembles consist of seven Ru atoms, or more. In Ru2P, the Ru ensemble size is smaller, and each Ru atom has four adjacent Ru atoms exposed on a (210) facet. In addition, the Ru-Ru bond distance is longer than that in metallic Ru. Further increasing the P content, that is, in RuP, leads to complete isolation of contiguous Ru atoms by P atoms. The specific composition and surface structures also correlate with their catalytic performance. Since hydrogenolysis and coke formation are sensitive to the surface structure, the decrease in the Ru ensemble size significantly reduces the hydrogenolysis rate. (3,6,18) For example, in the monometallic Ru catalyst, bonding of reaction intermediates is strong, leading to excessive hydrogenolysis and low propylene selectivity (Table 2). Once a Ru2P NP is formed, on the Ru2P (210) surface, the Ru-Ru ensembles comprise four Ru atoms, hydrogenolysis is inhibited, and propylene selectivity increases to 77% (at 25% conversion). Further isolation of Ru by P in RuP leads to further suppression of the hydrogenolysis rate and a propylene selectivity of 91%, which is similar to geometric effects in Pt3M and PtM intermetallic alloys with Zn, Cu, Sn, Mn, and V. (11,15,18,55,56,60)

For Group 8 transition metals, the chemical properties are determined by the energy of the filled d orbitals, for example, 4d orbitals in Ru. (5658) As shown in Figures 2 and 3A, the formation of the Ru-P bond affects the XPS and XANES spectra, resulting in a shift to higher 3d binding energy and K-edge XANES (1 s to 5p transition) of the Ru. Although these are not the energy of the Ru 4d valence orbitals, a recent study of Pt3V intermetallic alloys showed that an increase in the Pt 4f XPS binding energy and L3-edge XANES energy correlated with a decrease energy of the Pt-filled 5d orbitals determined by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS). (59) Similar to Pt3V, in a PtZn intermetallic alloy, the XANES energy, that is, the energy of the unfilled orbitals, increased, which was accompanied by an identical decrease in the energy of the filled 5d orbitals measured by RIXS. (18) Thus, the increase in Ru XPS binding energies and shift to higher edge energy of the K-edge XANES spectra suggest that the energy of Ru-P 4d orbitals is lower than those in Ru NPs. These changes increase with an increasing P:Ru atomic ratio and also correlate with the increased TORs. By lowering the energy of the Ru 4d orbitals, Ru-alkene bonds are weakened, resulting in lower surface coverage. (60,61) Facile propylene desorption would also be expected to lower the rate of consecutive reactions, such as hydrogenolysis and coking. Weaker adsorbate binding would also lower the H2 surface coverage, thus lowering the hydrogenolysis rate and improving the olefin selectivity. Similar conclusions from theoretical and experimental studies have been reported in other alloy dehydrogenation catalysts. (12,62)
5. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The results from this study demonstrate that even for a poorly olefin selective catalytic metals such as Ru, it is possible to modify the structure and energy of the valence orbitals to significantly improve the catalytic performance. SiO2-supported Ru2P and RuP phases were prepared by composition turning by the P content with H3PO4 as the phosphorus source, and the structural evolution was confirmed by XPS, EXAFS, and HAADF-STEM analysis, allowing for the evaluation of the influence of surface composition on the catalytic properties. For the series of Ru-P catalysts, the propylene selectivity increased almost linearly with increasing P level in the NPs, and the RuP (structure type MnP) catalyst showed 91% propylene selectivity at 25% propane conversion. The fully isolated Ru sites in RuP significantly improved the olefin selectivity by suppressing the hydrogenolysis rate. In addition, with increasing P content in the Ru NPs, there was a corresponding increase in the XPS binding energy and XANES edge energy, which were suggested to lead to lowering of the energy of the Ru 4d orbitals, which form metal-adsorbate bonds. By weakening these bonds, propylene and H2 surface coverages are lower, leading to higher rates and less cracking to light byproducts. Moreover, these structural and electronic changes, for example, in RuP phosphide also improved the stability. This surface composition tuning of metal phosphides could provide a feasible strategy for versatile catalyst design targeting different catalytic processes.
