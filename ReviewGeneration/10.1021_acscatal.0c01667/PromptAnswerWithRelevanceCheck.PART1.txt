[1] The article evaluates metal phosphide catalysts based on Ru for propane dehydrogenation. The Ru phosphide catalysts are systematically tuned by changing the P/Ru ratio during synthesis. The catalysts show improved propane dehydrogenation performance compared to monometallic Ru nanoparticles. In particular, the RuP (Ru phosphide with 1:1 Ru:P ratio) catalyst achieves 91% propylene selectivity at 25% propane conversion, much higher than Ru nanoparticles.

<quotes>

[1] The article evaluates supported monometallic Ru nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation. The performance of Ru nanoparticles is compared to Pt nanoparticles and Ru phosphide nanoparticles. 

[2] At 25% propane conversion and 600°C, the propylene selectivity of monometallic Ru nanoparticles is only 4.5%. This is much lower than Pt nanoparticles (46% selectivity) and Ru phosphide nanoparticles (up to 91% for RuP).

</quotes>

<English version answer>

5. Yes, the article evaluates supported monometallic Ru nanoparticles for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that at 600°C and 25% conversion, Ru nanoparticles have very low propylene selectivity of only 4.5%. This is far inferior to Pt nanoparticles (46% selectivity) and optimized Ru phosphide nanoparticles (up to 91% selectivity).

</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>

5. 是的,本文评价了支持的单金属Ru纳米粒子进行丙烷脱氢。它显示在600°C和25%转化率时,Ru纳米粒子的丙烯选择性非常低,只有4.5%。这远远低于Pt纳米粒子(选择性46%)和优化的Ru磷化物纳米粒子(选择性高达91%)。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] The article shows that increasing the P content in Ru nanoparticles reduces the Ru ensemble size. This lowers the hydrogenolysis rate and improves propylene selectivity.

[2] In RuP nanoparticles, each Ru atom is fully isolated by P atoms. This structure gives 91% propylene selectivity at 25% conversion, much higher than monometallic Ru.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

6. Yes, the article investigates how properties like particle composition affect performance. It shows increasing P content reduces the Ru ensemble size, which lowers hydrogenolysis and improves propylene selectivity. In RuP nanoparticles, isolated Ru sites give 91% selectivity, much higher than monometallic Ru.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

6. 是的,本文研究了像粒子组成等性质如何影响性能。它显示P含量的增加减小了Ru团簇大小,这降低了氢裂化反应并提高了丙烯选择性。在RuP纳米粒子中,被P原子完全隔离的Ru位点使选择性达到91%,远高于单金属Ru。

<Answer>
 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that directly address the questions asked. The article focuses on evaluating metal phosphide catalysts, specifically Ru-P, for propane dehydrogenation. It does not evaluate metal oxide or supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt or Pd. The article also does not investigate the effects of properties like oxidation state, oxygen mobility, particle size, or shape on the performance of the catalysts. No mechanistic reaction pathways are proposed for propane dehydrogenation over the studied catalysts. The article is solely focused on systematically tuning the composition and structure of Ru-P nanoparticles by altering the P/Ru ratio and correlating the changes observed through various characterization techniques to the resulting propane dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.
