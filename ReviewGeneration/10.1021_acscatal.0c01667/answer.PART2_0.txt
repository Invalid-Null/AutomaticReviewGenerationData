<quotes>
[1] "Similar to Pt3V, in a PtZn intermetallic alloy, the XANES energy, that is, the energy of the unfilled orbitals, increased, which was accompanied by an identical decrease in the energy of the filled 5d orbitals measured by RIXS. (18)"

[2] "These changes increase with an increasing P:Ru atomic ratio and also correlate with the increased TORs. By lowering the energy of the Ru 4d orbitals, Ru-alkene bonds are weakened, resulting in lower surface coverage. (60,61)"

3. Yes, the paper investigates electronic and geometric effects of phosphorus in the bimetallic Ru-P catalysts. It shows that increasing P content weakens Ru-alkene bonds by lowering the energy of Ru 4d orbitals, resulting in lower surface coverage and higher turnover rates. The isolated Ru sites in RuP also limit the formation of Ru ensembles needed for hydrogenolysis.

<quotes>
[1] "The Ru ensembles are shown by the dotted yellow lines in Figure 11, and Ru NPs ensembles consist of seven Ru atoms, or more. In Ru2P, the Ru ensemble size is smaller, and each Ru atom has four adjacent Ru atoms exposed on a (210) facet." 

[2] "Once a Ru2P NP is formed, on the Ru2P (210) surface, the Ru-Ru ensembles comprise four Ru atoms, hydrogenolysis is inhibited, and propylene selectivity increases to 77% (at 25% conversion)."

<English version answer> 
5. Yes, the paper describes synergistic ensemble effects between Ru and P in the bimetallic catalysts. It shows smaller Ru ensembles in Ru2P limit hydrogenolysis compared to larger Ru ensembles in monometallic Ru NPs, resulting in higher propylene selectivity.

5. 是的,该论文描述了二金属催化剂中Ru和P之间的协同集合效应。它表明,与单金属Ru纳米粒子中的较大Ru集合体相比,Ru2P中的较小Ru集合体限制了氢解,从而提高了丙烯选择性。
