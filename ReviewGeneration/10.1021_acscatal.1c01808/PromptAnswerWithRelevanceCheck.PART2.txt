[1] A PtZn alloy nanoparticle catalyst for propane dehydrogenation was synthesized by simple coimpregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 with Zn(NO3)2 onto a mesoporous material, which was built with siliceous MFI zeolite nanosheets.

[2] This mesoporous zeolite-supported PtZn catalyst exhibited high activity and selectivity with remarkably long catalytic lifetime compared with other PtZn catalysts loaded on γ-alumina, MCM-48 mesoporous silica, silica gel, and bulk MFI zeolite. 

[3] Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopic analysis revealed that the mesoporous zeolite contained finely dispersed Pt1Zn1 intermetallic compound-type alloy nanoparticles, which could effectively suppress catalyst deactivation.

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates MFI zeolite support for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It synthesizes a PtZn alloy nanoparticle catalyst on a mesoporous MFI zeolite support. This catalyst showed high activity, selectivity and long lifetime compared to PtZn catalysts on other supports including bulk MFI zeolite. STEM analysis revealed the mesoporous MFI zeolite contained highly dispersed intermetallic PtZn nanoparticles that suppressed deactivation.

Answer: 是的,这篇文章评估了MFI沸石作为丙烷脱氢反应催化剂的载体。它在介孔MFI沸石载体上合成了PtZn合金纳米粒子催化剂。与其他载体(包括大孔MFI沸石)上的PtZn催化剂相比,这个催化剂表现出高活性、选择性和长期稳定性。STEM分析表明,介孔MFI沸石包含高度分散的互化合物PtZn纳米粒子,抑制了失活。
