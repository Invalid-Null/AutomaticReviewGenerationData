[1] "To MZ, an aqueous solution with appropriate concentrations of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O to yield 1 wt % Pt and 1 wt % Zn in the final sample was coimpregnated by the conventional incipient-wetness method followed by heat treatment under an O2 flow at 350 C and a H2 flow at 580 C."

[2] "In the case of the 1Pt1Zn/BZ catalyst, the size of metal nanoparticles was observed to be irregular due to the formation of large agglomerates (up to 100 nm) on the external surface of the zeolite (Figure S5)." 

[3] "On the other hand, the PtZn alloy nanoparticles on 1Pt1Zn/MCM-48 were homogeneously distributed throughout the support (Figure S5)."

<English version answer>  
Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses incipient wetness impregnation to load Pt and Zn metals onto various zeolite and silica supports. It finds that mesoporous zeolite (MZ) confines the metal nanoparticles and prevents sintering, resulting in better dispersion than bulk zeolite (BZ) which forms large agglomerates, or MCM-48 which distributes nanoparticles homogeneously but without size control.
