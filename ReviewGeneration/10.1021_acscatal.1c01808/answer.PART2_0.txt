[1] PtZn alloy nanoparticle catalyst for propane dehydrogenation was synthesized by simple coimpregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 with Zn(NO3)2 onto a mesoporous material
[2] this mesoporous zeolite-supported PtZn catalyst exhibited high activity and selectivity with remarkably long catalytic lifetime compared with other PtZn catalysts loaded on γ-alumina, MCM-48 mesoporous silica, silica gel, and bulk MFI zeolite.
[3] Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopic analysis revealed that the mesoporous zeolite contained finely dispersed Pt1Zn1 intermetallic compound-type alloy nanoparticles, which could effectively suppress catalyst deactivation.

2. Yes, the article evaluates PtZn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that PtZn alloy nanoparticles supported on mesoporous zeolite exhibit high activity, selectivity and long lifetime compared to PtZn catalysts on other supports like alumina, MCM-48, silica gel and bulk MFI zeolite. The PtZn intermetallic nanoparticles are finely dispersed and suppress deactivation.

[1] The incorporation of the second metal can physically break down the large Pt ensembles, which are responsible for hydrogenolysis and coke formation and change the electronic environment of Pt to facilitate propylene desorption and slow down the deactivation process.
[2] Compared to disordered alloys, the intermetallic alloys having an ordered arrangement of atoms with a specific composition and definite crystal structure can exhibit a greater reduction in Pt ensemble size. 
[3] In this aspect, the intermetallic alloys showed a significant improvement in the stability of the catalyst.

3. Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It shows that adding a second metal can break down large Pt ensembles to suppress hydrogenolysis and coking, facilitate propylene desorption, and improve stability. Intermetallic alloys with ordered structure and specific composition further reduce Pt ensemble size compared to disordered alloys, greatly improving catalyst stability.

[1] Recently, our group demonstrated an effective synthesis strategy for Pt-rare earth element (REE) intermetallic alloys in the form of small nanoparticles using ahierarchically micro-mesoporous MFI zeolite as a support material.
[2] In the present work, we extend the concept of the silanol nest-assisted intermetallic alloy formation to show that isolated silanol groups on the surface of mesoporous zeolite can also promote intermetallic alloy formation between Pt and more easily reducible metal elements.
