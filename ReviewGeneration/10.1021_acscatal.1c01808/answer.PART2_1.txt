[1] "In this regard, we examined whether intermetallic compound-type alloys can be formed when Pt and Ga are loaded on MZ." 

[2] "The promotional effect by the second metal addition to Pt has been reported to dramatically increase when intermetallic compound-type alloy nanoparticles are formed."

[3] "A PtZn alloy nanoparticle catalyst for propane dehydrogenation was synthesized by simple coimpregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 with Zn(NO3)2 onto a mesoporous material"

[4] "This mesoporous zeolite-supported PtZn catalyst exhibited high activity and selectivity with remarkably long catalytic lifetime compared with other PtZn catalysts loaded on γ-alumina, MCM-48 mesoporous silica, silica gel, and bulk MFI zeolite."

[5] "The Pt1Zn1 intermetallic alloy catalyst supported on mesoporous zeolite exhibited outstanding catalytic durability, which was the highest among those of the reported Pt-based alloy catalysts to the best of our knowledge."

<English version answer>  
2. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates PtZn, PtGa, and PtIn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that PtZn, PtGa, and PtIn intermetallic alloy nanoparticles supported on mesoporous zeolite exhibit much higher activity and stability compared to Pt alone or PtZn, PtGa, PtIn supported on other materials like alumina, bulk zeolite, silica gel, and MCM-48. The mesoporous zeolite-supported PtZn catalyst showed the highest durability among reported Pt catalysts.

[1] "The incorporation of the second metal can physically break down the large Pt ensembles, which are responsible for hydrogenolysis and coke formation and change the electronic environment of Pt to facilitate propylene desorption and slow down the deactivation process."

[2] "Compared to disordered alloys, the intermetallic alloys having an ordered arrangement of atoms with a specific composition and definite crystal structure can exhibit a greater reduction in Pt ensemble size."

[3] "Moreover, the crystalline structure of these alloys provides an enhancement in thermal stability compared to single atom or metal cluster catalysts."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
3. Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It explains that the second metal breaks down large Pt ensembles to reduce coking, alters the electronic environment to improve selectivity, and the ordered intermetallic structure provides thermal stability compared to single atoms.
</English version answer>

[1] "In the case of the 1 wt % Pt and 1 wt % Zn supported on BZ catalyst (hereafter denoted as 1Pt1Zn/BZ), which has the same zeolite framework as the 1Pt1Zn/MZ catalyst, the initial catalytic activity was only about 8% and exhibited a rapid deactivation behavior."

[2] "This is attributed to the poor dispersion of PtZn alloy nanoparticles resulting from the solely microporous structure of BZ."
</quotes>

<English version answer>  
6. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates the MFI zeolite structure as a support for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows that a microporous MFI zeolite results in poor dispersion and rapid deactivation compared to a mesoporous MFI zeolite support.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
