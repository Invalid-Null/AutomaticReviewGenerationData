      [1] A PtZn alloy nanoparticle catalyst for propane dehydrogenation was synthesized by simple coimpregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 with Zn(NO3)2 onto a mesoporous material, which was built with siliceous MFI zeolite nanosheets.
      [2] The Pt1Zn1 intermetallic alloy catalyst supported on mesoporous zeolite exhibited outstanding catalytic durability, which was the highest among those of the reported Pt-based alloy catalysts to the best of our knowledge.
