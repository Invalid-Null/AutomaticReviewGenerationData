<quotes>
[1] "PDH reactions were performed using a fixed bed reactor built with a quartz tube (inner diameter of 8 mm). The catalysts used were shaped into pellets with diameters in the range of 150350 μm. This was done by pressing the powder form of the catalyst into a pellet and sieving it with a mesh. To the reactor, an appropriate amount (50 mg in the case of 1 wt % Pt loading) of the shaped catalyst was placed in the reactor, and the remaining space was filled with silica sand."

[2] "The Pt1Zn1 intermetallic structure was also viewed from other particles as shown in Figure 1d. In this case, the distance between the two Pt columns was measured to be 0.35 nm, which agrees well with the lattice spacing of the Pt1Zn1 alloy along the [001] direction."

[3] "The 1 wt % Pt and 1 wt % Zn catalyst supported on γ-alumina support (hereafter denoted as 1Pt1Zn/alumina) exhibited a relatively high initial conversion value but rapidly deactivated within half a day as in the case of 1Pt/MZ."

[4] "In the case of the 1 wt % Pt and 1 wt % Zn supported on BZ catalyst (hereafter denoted as 1Pt1Zn/BZ), which has the same zeolite framework as the 1Pt1Zn/MZ catalyst, the initial catalytic activity was only about 8% and exhibited a rapid deactivation behavior."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic Pt catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on the performance of 1 wt% Pt supported on mesoporous zeolite (1Pt/MZ), showing it has a relatively high initial propane conversion of 28% but deactivates rapidly within half a day. The article also characterizes the Pt1Zn1 intermetallic nanoparticles supported on various materials like alumina and bulk zeolite (BZ), providing insights into how support interactions affect catalytic performance. For example, 1Pt1Zn/alumina showed high initial activity but rapid deactivation, while 1Pt1Zn/BZ had low initial activity and rapid deactivation due to poor metal dispersion.

答:是的,文中评价了负载单金属Pt的支撑催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它提供了在介孔分子筛上负载1 wt% Pt (1Pt/MZ)的性能数据,显示该催化剂具有相对较高的初期丙烷转化率28%,但会在半天内快速失活。文中还表征了不同载体如氧化铝和块状分子筛上负载的Pt1Zn1中间态纳米粒子(1Pt1Zn/氧化铝和1Pt1Zn/BZ),提供了对支撑体相互作用如何影响催化性能的见解。例如,1Pt1Zn/氧化铝显示了高初期活性但快速失活,而1Pt1Zn/BZ由于金属分散差,显示了低初期活性和快速失活。

[1] "The size of the PtZn alloy nanoparticles remained unchanged during the reaction, as shown in the STEM image of the spent 1Pt1Zn/MZ catalyst that was collected after the catalyst has been deactivated to reach a propane conversion of 3% (Figure S7). The particle size distribution plots of the fresh and spent catalysts were identical, suggesting that the sintering of PtZn alloy nanoparticles did not occur during the PDH reaction (Figure S8)." 

[2] the metal loading was decreased to 0.7 wt % Pt and 0.7 wt % Zn on MZ (hereafter denoted as 0.7Pt0.7Zn/MZ), the rate of catalyst deactivation was tremendously decreased as shown in Figure 2. The initial propane conversion was 35%, which only decreased to 20% even after 20 days of reaction. Such enhancement in catalyst stability is ascribed to the reduction in the size of the metal nanoparticles."

[3] "The major reason for the deactivation of the 1Pt1Zn/MZ catalyst seems to be the formation of coke deposits. Although the coke formation rate of the 1Pt1Zn/MZ catalyst (0.006 gcoke gcat-1 h-1) was much slower than that of the conventional PtSn/alumina catalyst (0.03 gcoke gcat-1 h-1), the formation of coke deposits over a long period of reaction time seems to trigger catalyst deactivation."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of the supported PtZn catalysts. It shows the PtZn nanoparticle size remained unchanged during reaction, indicating sintering was not the cause of deactivation. Lowering metal loading to 0.7Pt0.7Zn/MZ decreased particle size and tremendously enhanced catalyst stability. Coke formation over time is identified as the likely cause of deactivation.

答:是的,文中研究了金属颗粒尺寸、形状以及支撑体相互作用等性质如何影响负载PtZn催化剂的性能。结果显示,PtZn纳米粒子尺寸在反应过程中保持不变,表明烧结不是失活的原因。降低金属负载量至0.7Pt0.7Zn/MZ使粒子尺寸减小,极大提高了催化剂稳定性。随着时间的推移,焦炭沉积被认为是导致失活的可能原因。
