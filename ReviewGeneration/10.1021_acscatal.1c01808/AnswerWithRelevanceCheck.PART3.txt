         [1] "The catalytic enhancement observed for the 1Pt1Zn/MZ catalyst seems to be mainly attributable to the formation of Pt1Zn1 intermetallic alloy nanoparticles."

         [2] "Recently, there have been several reports that use zeolite as a support material for Pt-based alloy catalysts in PDH."  
      
         [3] "Among those, we chose the sub-nanometer PtZn cluster catalyst encapsulated inside siliceous bulk MFI zeolite reported by Sun et al., which showed the highest stability among the state-of-the-art Pt-based PDH catalysts up to date."

         [1] "To MZ, an aqueous solution with appropriate concentrations of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O to yield 1 wt % Pt and 1 wt % Zn in the final sample was coimpregnated by the conventional incipient-wetness method followed by heat treatment under an O2 flow at 350 C and a H2 flow at 580 C."

         [2] "The 1 wt % Pt and 1 wt % Zn loaded MZ sample is referred to as 1Pt1Zn/MZ."  

         [3] "The metal nanoparticles were confirmed to contain both Pt and Zn with a Pt/Zn atomic ratio of 1, according to the calculated value derived from the EDS results shown in Figure S2."

         Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It uses incipient wetness impregnation to load Pt and Zn onto the mesoporous zeolite support, controlling the concentration to achieve 1 wt% of each metal. EDS confirms the nanoparticles contain both metals in a 1:1 ratio.
