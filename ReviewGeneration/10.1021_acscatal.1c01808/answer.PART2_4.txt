[1] A PtZn alloy nanoparticle catalyst for propane dehydrogenation was synthesized by simple coimpregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 with Zn(NO3)2 onto a mesoporous material, which was built with siliceous MFI zeolite nanosheets. 

[2] This mesoporous zeolite-supported PtZn catalyst exhibited high activity and selectivity with remarkably long catalytic lifetime compared with other PtZn catalysts loaded on γ-alumina, MCM-48 mesoporous silica, silica gel, and bulk MFI zeolite.

[3] Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopic analysis revealed that the mesoporous zeolite contained finely dispersed Pt1Zn1 intermetallic compound-type alloy nanoparticles, which could effectively suppress catalyst deactivation.

[1] The incorporation of the second metal can physically break down the large Pt ensembles, which are responsible for hydrogenolysis and coke formation and change the electronic environment of Pt to facilitate propylene desorption and slow down the deactivation process.

[2] Compared to disordered alloys, the intermetallic alloys having an ordered arrangement of atoms with a specific composition and definite crystal structure can exhibit a greater reduction in Pt ensemble size.

[3] Moreover, the crystalline structure of these alloys provides an enhancement in thermal stability compared to single atom or metal cluster catalysts.

[4] In this aspect, the intermetallic alloys showed a significant improvement in the stability of the catalyst.

Answer: Yes, the article investigates electronic and geometric effects of the secondary metal in bimetallic and alloy catalysts. It explains that adding a second metal can break down large Pt ensembles responsible for side reactions and coking, and modify the electronic environment of Pt to improve propylene desorption and stability. It also shows intermetallic alloys with ordered crystal structures can decrease Pt ensemble size more than disordered alloys, and have enhanced thermal stability over single atoms or clusters. Thus intermetallic alloys significantly improve catalyst stability.
