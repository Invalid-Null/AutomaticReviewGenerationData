<quotes>
[1] A PtZn alloy nanoparticle catalyst for propane dehydrogenation was synthesized by simple coimpregnation of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 with Zn(NO3)2 onto a mesoporous material, which was built with siliceous MFI zeolite nanosheets. 
[2] Compared to disordered alloys, the intermetallic alloys having an ordered arrangement of atoms with a specific composition and definite crystal structure can exhibit a greater reduction in Pt ensemble size. Moreover, the crystalline structure of these alloys provides an enhancement in thermal stability compared to single atom or metal cluster catalysts.
[3] The PtZn/mesoporous zeolite catalyst with metal loadings of 0.7 wt % Pt and 0.7 wt % Zn lasted for more than 20 days before the propane conversion decreased to half of its initial value. In comparison, other PtZn catalysts were deactivated almost completely within a few days.

2. Yes, the article evaluates PtZn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that a PtZn intermetallic alloy supported on mesoporous zeolite exhibits much higher durability compared to PtZn alloys on other supports like alumina. The ordered intermetallic structure provides enhanced thermal stability and reduces the Pt ensemble size.
