[1] "Recently, our group demonstrated an effective synthesis strategy for Pt-rare earth element (REE) intermetallic alloys in the form of small nanoparticles using a hierarchically micro-mesoporous MFI zeolite as a support material." 

[2] "In the present work, we extend the concept of the silanol nest-assisted intermetallic alloy formation to show that isolated silanol groups on the surface of mesoporous zeolite can also promote intermetallic alloy formation between Pt and more easily reducible metal elements."

[3] "In this regard, we examined whether intermetallic compound-type alloys can be formed when Pt and Ga are loaded on MZ."

[4] "The PtGa supported on MZ catalyst (hereafter denoted as 1Pt1Ga/MZ) was prepared by supporting 1 wt % Pt and 1 wt % Ga using Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and Ga(NO3)3·xH2O as the precursors and following the same metal loading procedure for 1Pt1Zn/MZ."

[5] "In addition, as shown in Figure 5e, the distance between the two Pt columns matched well with the reported lattice spacing of the Pt3Ga1 alloy along the [001] direction."

[6] "Such a trend was also observed in the case of the PtIn supported catalysts, which were prepared in the same manner using Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 and In(NO3)3·xH2O as precursors, as shown in Figure S16."

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Zn, Pt-Ga, and Pt-In alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on the atomic structure, morphology, and catalytic performance of Pt-Zn, Pt-Ga, and Pt-In intermetallic nanoparticles supported on mesoporous zeolite. The article shows these intermetallic alloy nanoparticles exhibit high activity, selectivity, and stability for propane dehydrogenation.
