[1] "The PtZn alloy nanoparticles on 1Pt1Zn/MCM-48 were homogeneously distributed throughout the support (Figure S5). However, in the case of 1Pt1Zn/MCM-48, the intermetallic compound-type alloy structure was not observed from the AR-HAADF-STEM analysis." 

[2] "In the case of 1Pt1Zn/BZ, which has the same zeolite framework as the 1Pt1Zn/MZ catalyst, the initial catalytic activity was only about 8% and exhibited a rapid deactivation behavior."

2. The article evaluates metal encapsulation in zeolite supports for enhancing propane dehydrogenation catalyst stability. It provides the example of encapsulating PtZn clusters inside bulk MFI zeolite (1Pt1Zn/BZ), but finds this catalyst had low initial activity of 8% and rapid deactivation compared to PtZn supported on mesoporous MFI zeolite (1Pt1Zn/MZ).

[1] "The mesoporous structure of the zeolite provided effective confinement of the metal species inside the mesopores to result in the formation of highly dispersed small PtZn alloy nanoparticles."

[2] "In the case of 1Pt1Zn/silica gel, the dispersion of the supported PtZn metal alloys was similar to that of 1Pt1Zn/MCM-48 (Figure S5). However, some of the supported metal particles were composed of monometallic Pt as determined from the EDS analysis."

3. The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using the mesoporous structure of zeolite to confine PtZn nanoparticles and prevent sintering, resulting in highly dispersed small nanoparticles. It also shows silica gel gave poor dispersion with some monometallic Pt particles.
