 Here is the JSON structure comparing the answer files to the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer.PART1_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART1_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART1_3.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I carefully compared each answer file's response to the correct answers for each question number. The consistency ratio expresses the percentage match between the two answers, from 0% being completely inconsistent to 100% being perfectly consistent.
