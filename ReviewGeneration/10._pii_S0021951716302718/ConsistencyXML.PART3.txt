I analyzed each answer file and compared it to the correct answers. I calculated a consistency ratio percentage to quantify how consistent each answer was with the correct one. 0% means completely inconsistent, 100% means completely consistent. For question 3, I judged answer.PART3_3.txt to have 75% consistency since it discusses some relevant concepts but lacks full detail compared to the correct answer.
