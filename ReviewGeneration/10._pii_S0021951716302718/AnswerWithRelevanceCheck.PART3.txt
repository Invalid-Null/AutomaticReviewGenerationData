         [1] "MPS addition led to a greater number of strong Lewis acid sites, thus decreasing the B/L ratio."
         [2] "The PDH selectivity of gallosilicate molecular sieves is known to be strongly affected by the concentration of strong Lewis acid sites, with the most effective catalysts having a small concentration of Brønsted acid sites coupled with strong Lewis acidity."
         [3] "Therefore, the new gallosilicates prepared by MPS addition have acidities that are well-aligned with selective PDH catalysis."
         [4] "The concentration of strong Lewis acid sites can be controlled by adjusting the amount of MPS added, with more MPS generating more strong Lewis acid sites.

         Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it studies the addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) during gallosilicate MFI zeolite synthesis to enhance the number of strong Lewis acid sites without additional post-synthesis treatments. The MPS addition tunes the distribution of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, decreasing Brønsted sites while increasing Lewis acidity. This optimizes the catalyst for propane dehydrogenation by lowering cracking activity and increasing desired dehydrogenation activity and propylene selectivity. The concentration of strong Lewis acid sites can be controlled by the amount of MPS added.

         答:是的,本文研究了针对优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。具体来说,它研究了在盖氏硅分子筛MFI沸石合成过程中添加3-巯基丙基三甲氧基硅烷(MPS)以增强强Lewis酸位的数量,而无需额外的合成后处理。MPS的添加调节了Brønsted酸位和Lewis酸位的分布,降低了Brønsted酸位,同时增加了Lewis酸性。这通过降低裂化活性和提高期望的脱氢活性和丙烯选择性,优化了催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。强Lewis酸位的浓度可以通过所添加MPS的量来控制。
