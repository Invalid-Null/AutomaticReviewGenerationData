<quotes>
[1] Gallosilicate MFI can also be obtained by isomorphous substitution of Ga in the MFI zeolite framework [32], [33], since Ga can be easily incorporated in the MFI framework.

[2] Ga-modified MFI zeolite catalysts have been widely used in the UOP/BP Cyclar dehydrocyclization process [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. 

[3] In this pathway, propane is first protonated on Brønsted acid sites where it undergoes either a dehydrogenation or a cracking step. A carbenium ion intermediate formed by the dehydrogenation pathway is then converted into propylene, followed by oligomerization and cyclization to aromatics at the Brønsted acid sites.

[4] Ga-containing zeolites synthesized by impregnation or ion-exchange into aluminosilicate H-ZSM-5 have been extensively studied [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31].

[5] In an early report, Bayense et al. reported that the specific synthesis method used for Ga incorporation into HZSM-5 did not have much effect on the propane conversion, but incorporation of Ga increased the aromatic selectivity in all cases [24].

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates some zeolite supports like MFI for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It notes that gallosilicate MFI can be obtained by isomorphous substitution of Ga into the MFI framework, and Ga-modified MFI has been used commercially for propane aromatization. The article also discusses how Ga incorporation into H-ZSM-5 has been extensively studied and can increase aromatic selectivity. Propane dehydrogenation over Ga-zeolites is suggested to occur via protonation on Brønsted acid sites followed by dehydrogenation and conversion to olefins like propylene.

Answer: 是的,该文评估了一些分子筛支撑体,如MFI,用于丙烷脱氢催化剂。文中指出镓可以同型取代到MFI框架中形成硅镓MFI,且已商业应用于丙烷芳构化。文中也讨论了将镓掺入H-ZSM-5的研究非常广泛,可以提高芳烃选择性。在镓分子筛上丙烷脱氢的过程被认为是先在质子化强酸点上质子化,然后脱氢生成烯烃如丙烯。

<English version answer>
Answer: No, the article does not investigate the effects of tuning zeolite Si/Al ratio or incorporating mesoporosity on propane dehydrogenation catalyst performance. It focuses solely on gallium-containing purely siliceous MFI zeolites without any aluminum. 
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 否,该文没有研究调节分子筛Si/Al比或引入介孔对丙烷脱氢催化剂性能的影响。文中仅聚焦于纯硅镓MFI分子筛,不含任何铝。
