<quotes>
[1] The reactivity of the catalysts prepared in the presence of MPS demonstrates that these catalysts are more effective for PDH than gallosilicate catalysts prepared without the MPS functional silane, having good propane conversion rates and higher selectivity to propylene.

[2] Decreasing the B/L ratio leads to better performance in PDH with higher activity and propylene selectivity.

[3] The resulting gallosilicate MFI materials had reduced concentrations of Brønsted acid sites and more Lewis acid sites, with significant concentrations of strong Lewis acid sites, as confirmed by NH3-TPD, IPA-TPD and pyridine IR. These strong Lewis acid sites were achieved without post-synthesis impregnation of extra-framework Ga or high temperature heat treatments. 

[4] The concentration of strong Lewis acid sites can be controlled by adjusting the amount of MPS added, with more MPS generating more strong Lewis acid sites.

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it studies the addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) during gallosilicate MFI zeolite synthesis to enhance the number of strong Lewis acid sites without additional post-synthesis treatments. The MPS addition tunes the distribution of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, decreasing Brønsted sites while increasing Lewis acidity. This optimizes the catalyst for propane dehydrogenation by lowering cracking activity and increasing desired dehydrogenation activity and propylene selectivity. The concentration of strong Lewis acid sites can be controlled by the amount of MPS added.

答:是的,本文研究了针对优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。具体来说,它研究了在盖氏硅分子筛MFI沸石合成过程中添加3-巯基丙基三甲氧基硅烷(MPS)以增强强 Lewis酸位的数量,而无需额外的合成后处理。MPS的添加调节了Brønsted酸位和Lewis酸位的分布,降低了Brønsted酸位,同时增加了Lewis酸性。这通过降低裂化活性和提高期望的脱氢活性和丙烯选择性,优化了催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。强Lewis酸位的浓度可以通过所添加MPS的量来控制。
