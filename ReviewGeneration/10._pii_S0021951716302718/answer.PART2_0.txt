<quotes>
[1] "Ga-modified MFI zeolite catalysts have been widely used in the UOP/BP Cyclar dehydrocyclization process [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Ga-containing zeolites synthesized by impregnation or ion-exchange into aluminosilicate H-ZSM-5 have been extensively studied [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]."

[2] "In an early report, Bayense et al. reported that the specific synthesis method used for Ga incorporation into HZSM-5 did not have much effect on the propane conversion, but incorporation of Ga increased the aromatic selectivity in all cases [24]."

[3] "They also suggested that Ga-loaded H-ZSM-5 was better than the pure gallosilicate for propane aromatization." 

[4] "However, other studies have reported that H-gallosilicate showed higher propane aromatization selectivities than Ga ion-exchanged/impregnated H-ZSM-5 [34], [35], [36]."

[5] "A reaction mechanism of propane aromatization using Ga loaded HZSM-5 was suggested by Giannetto et al. [37]." 

[6] "In this pathway, propane is first protonated on Brønsted acid sites where it undergoes either a dehydrogenation or a cracking step."

[7] "A carbenium ion intermediate formed by the dehydrogenation pathway is then converted into propylene, followed by oligomerization and cyclization to aromatics at the Brønsted acid sites."

[8] "In propane aromatization, PDH is a primary step, as discussed in detail by Meriaudeau and Naccache [23], [38]."

[9] "They proposed a bifunctional mechanism during the PDH step when both Ga oxide species (Ga2O3) and Brønsted acid sites in the MFI pores are present."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates zeolite supports like MFI for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically:

- Ga-modified MFI zeolites have been widely used industrially for propane dehydrogenation and aromatization (quotes 1-2). 

- Both Ga-exchanged/impregnated H-ZSM-5 and pure gallosilicate MFI have been studied, with some disagreement about which performs better (quotes 2-4).

- The proposed reaction mechanism involves both Ga oxide species and Bronsted acid sites in the MFI pores (quotes 5-9).

<Chinese version answer>  
答案:是的,这篇文章评估了MFI等分子筛作为丙烷脱氢催化剂的支撑体。具体来说:

- Ga修饰的MFI分子筛已在工业上广泛用于丙烷脱氢和芳构化(引用1-2)。

- Ga交换/浸渍的H-ZSM-5和纯硅铝质MFI分子筛都有研究,但对于哪种性能更好还有些争论(引用2-4)。 

- 建议的反应机理涉及MFI孔内的Ga氧化物和质子酸中心(引用5-9)。
