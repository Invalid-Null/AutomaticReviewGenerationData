<quotes>
[1] "Ga-modified MFI zeolite catalysts have been widely used in the UOP/BP Cyclar dehydrocyclization process [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Ga-containing zeolites synthesized by impregnation or ion-exchange into aluminosilicate H-ZSM-5 have been extensively studied [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]."

[2] "In an early report, Bayense et al. reported that the specific synthesis method used for Ga incorporation into HZSM-5 did not have much effect on the propane conversion, but incorporation of Ga increased the aromatic selectivity in all cases [24]."

[3] "They also suggested that Ga-loaded H-ZSM-5 was better than the pure gallosilicate for propane aromatization." 

[4] "However, other studies have reported that H-gallosilicate showed higher propane aromatization selectivities than Ga ion-exchanged/impregnated H-ZSM-5 [34], [35], [36]."

[5] "A reaction mechanism of propane aromatization using Ga loaded HZSM-5 was suggested by Giannetto et al. [37]." 

[6] "In this pathway, propane is first protonated on Brønsted acid sites where it undergoes either a dehydrogenation or a cracking step."

[7] "A carbenium ion intermediate formed by the dehydrogenation pathway is then converted into propylene, followed by oligomerization and cyclization to aromatics at the Brønsted acid sites."

[8] "In propane aromatization, PDH is a primary step, as discussed in detail by Meriaudeau and Naccache [23], [38]."

[9] "They proposed a bifunctional mechanism during the PDH step when both Ga oxide species (Ga2O3) and Brønsted acid sites in the MFI pores are present." 

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates zeolite supports like MFI for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically:

- Ga-modified MFI zeolites have been widely used industrially for propane dehydrogenation and aromatization (quotes 1-2). 

- Both Ga-exchanged/impregnated H-ZSM-5 and pure gallosilicate MFI have been studied, with some disagreement about which performs better (quotes 2-4).

- The proposed reaction mechanism involves both Ga oxide species and Bronsted acid sites in the MFI pores (quotes 5-9).
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>  
答案:是的,这篇文章评估了MFI等分子筛作为丙烷脱氢催化剂的支撑体。具体来说:

- Ga交换/浸渍的H-ZSM-5和纯硅铝质MFI分子筛都有研究,但对于哪种性能更好还有些争论(引用2-4)。 

- 建议的反应机理涉及MFI孔内的Ga氧化物和质子酸中心(引用5-9)。

[1] "Ga-modified MFI zeolite catalysts have been widely used in the UOP/BP Cyclar dehydrocyclization process [16],[17],[18],[19],[20],[21],[22]."

[2] "In this study, gallosilicate MFI zeolites with perturbed acidities were prepared via the addition of MPS to the zeolite synthesis gel."

[3] "The resulting gallosilicate MFI materials had reduced concentrations of Brønsted acid sites and more Lewis acid sites, with significant concentrations of strong Lewis acid sites, as confirmed by NH3-TPD, IPA-TPD and pyridine IR." 

[4] "Compared with a benchmark chromia-alumina catalyst, a gallosilicate MFI catalyst prepared using MPS showed lower rate of deactivation than the benchmark catalyst."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates MFI zeolite supports for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It studies gallosilicate MFI zeolites modified with MPS during synthesis to tune the acid site distribution. The MPS-modified MFI catalysts have fewer Brønsted acid sites and more strong Lewis acid sites compared to MFI made without MPS. An MPS-modified MFI catalyst showed enhanced stability compared to a chromia-alumina catalyst.

答:是的,该文评估了MFI沸石作为丙烷脱氢反应催化剂的载体。文中研究了在合成过程中使用MPS修饰的镓硅MFI沸石,以调节酸中心分布。与不含MPS的MFI相比,MPS修饰的MFI催化剂具有更少的Brønsted酸中心和更多强Lewis酸中心。一种MPS修饰的MFI催化剂表现出比铬氧铝催化剂更好的稳定性。

[1] Gallosilicate MFI can also be obtained by isomorphous substitution of Ga in the MFI zeolite framework [32], [33], since Ga can be easily incorporated in the MFI framework.

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates some zeolite supports like MFI for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It notes that gallosilicate MFI can be obtained by isomorphous substitution of Ga into the MFI framework, and Ga-modified MFI has been used commercially for propane aromatization. The article also discusses how Ga incorporation into H-ZSM-5 has been extensively studied and can increase aromatic selectivity. Propane dehydrogenation over Ga-zeolites is suggested to occur via protonation on Brønsted acid sites followed by dehydrogenation and conversion to olefins like propylene.
