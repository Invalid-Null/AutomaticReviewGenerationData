<quotes>
[1] "Ga-modified MFI zeolite catalysts have been widely used in the UOP/BP Cyclar dehydrocyclization process [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]."

[2] "In an early report, Bayense et al. reported that the specific synthesis method used for Ga incorporation into HZSM-5 did not have much effect on the propane conversion, but incorporation of Ga increased the aromatic selectivity in all cases [24]."

[3] "Ga-containing zeolites synthesized by impregnation or ion-exchange into aluminosilicate H-ZSM-5 have been extensively studied [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]."

[4] "Gallosilicate MFI can also be obtained by isomorphous substitution of Ga in the MFI zeolite framework [32], [33], since Ga can be easily incorporated in the MFI framework."

[5] "Here, we report a detailed structural and catalytic (PDH) characterization of Ga-MFI catalysts prepared by this technique, based upon the hypothesis that the altered mechanisms of Ga incorporation induced by the addition of MPS would lead to a different acid site profiles and catalytic behavior."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates some zeolite supports like MFI for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It mentions that Ga-modified MFI zeolite catalysts have been used in propane aromatization processes (Quote 1). It also discusses prior work investigating Ga incorporation into HZSM-5 zeolites by impregnation or ion-exchange (Quote 3). The article prepares gallosilicate MFI catalysts by isomorphous substitution of Ga into the MFI framework (Quote 4) and studies their catalytic performance for PDH (Quote 5). However, the article does not provide any direct comparisons of different zeolite structures or investigate the effects of zeolite properties like Si/Al ratio or mesoporosity.
</English version answer>

答:是的,文章评估了一些沸石支持体,如MFI,用于丙烷脱氢催化剂。它提到Ga修饰的MFI沸石催化剂已被用于丙烷芳构化过程(引用1)。它还讨论了先前通过浸渍或离子交换将Ga掺入HZSM-5沸石的研究工作(引用3)。文章通过Ga的同质置换制备了MFI框架硅镓沸石催化剂(引用4),并研究了它们在PDH中的催化性能(引用5)。但是,文章没有提供不同沸石结构的直接比较,也没有研究沸石性质如Si/Al比或介孔性的影响。
