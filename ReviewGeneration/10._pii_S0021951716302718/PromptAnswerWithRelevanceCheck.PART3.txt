<quotes>
[1] The reactivity of the catalysts prepared in the presence of MPS demonstrates that these catalysts are more effective for PDH than gallosilicate catalysts prepared without the MPS functional silane, having good propane conversion rates and higher selectivity to propylene.

[2] Decreasing the B/L ratio leads to better performance in PDH with higher activity and propylene selectivity.

[3] The resulting gallosilicate MFI materials had reduced concentrations of Brønsted acid sites and more Lewis acid sites, with significant concentrations of strong Lewis acid sites, as confirmed by NH3-TPD, IPA-TPD and pyridine IR. These strong Lewis acid sites were achieved without post-synthesis impregnation of extra-framework Ga or high temperature heat treatments. 

[4] The concentration of strong Lewis acid sites can be controlled by adjusting the amount of MPS added, with more MPS generating more strong Lewis acid sites.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it studies the addition of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) during gallosilicate MFI zeolite synthesis to enhance the number of strong Lewis acid sites without additional post-synthesis treatments. The MPS addition tunes the distribution of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, decreasing Brønsted sites while increasing Lewis acidity. This optimizes the catalyst for propane dehydrogenation by lowering cracking activity and increasing desired dehydrogenation activity and propylene selectivity. The concentration of strong Lewis acid sites can be controlled by the amount of MPS added.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文研究了针对优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。具体来说,它研究了在盖氏硅分子筛MFI沸石合成过程中添加3-巯基丙基三甲氧基硅烷(MPS)以增强强 Lewis酸位的数量,而无需额外的合成后处理。MPS的添加调节了Brønsted酸位和Lewis酸位的分布,降低了Brønsted酸位,同时增加了Lewis酸性。这通过降低裂化活性和提高期望的脱氢活性和丙烯选择性,优化了催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。强Lewis酸位的浓度可以通过所添加MPS的量来控制。

<quotes>

[1] "MPS addition led to a greater number of strong Lewis acid sites, thus decreasing the B/L ratio."

[2] "The PDH selectivity of gallosilicate molecular sieves is known to be strongly affected by the concentration of strong Lewis acid sites, with the most effective catalysts having a small concentration of Brønsted acid sites coupled with strong Lewis acidity." 

[3] "Therefore, the new gallosilicates prepared by MPS addition have acidities that are well-aligned with selective PDH catalysis."

</quotes>

<English version answer>  

3. Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it studies the addition of 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS) during the hydrothermal synthesis of gallosilicate MFI zeolites. MPS addition is found to increase the number of strong Lewis acid sites and decrease the ratio of Brønsted to Lewis acid sites. The concentration of strong Lewis acid sites is known to strongly influence propane dehydrogenation selectivity, with the most selective catalysts having small Brønsted acidity and strong Lewis acidity. Thus, the MPS addition tunes the acid site distribution to favor propane dehydrogenation over cracking reactions.

3. 回答:这篇文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。具体来说,它研究了在水热合成钒硅分子筛MFI 分子筛的过程中添加3-巯基丙基三甲氧基硅烷(MPS)。发现MPS的添加增加了强路易斯酸的数量,并降低了勃朗斯特德酸与路易斯酸的比值。已知强路易斯酸的浓度强烈影响丙烷脱氢的选择性,最选择性的催化剂具有少量的勃朗斯特德酸和强的路易斯酸。因此,MPS的添加调节了酸位分布,有利于丙烷脱氢反应而不是裂化反应。

[1] "In an early report, Bayense et al. reported that the specific synthesis method used for Ga incorporation into HZSM-5 did not have much effect on the propane conversion, but incorporation of Ga increased the aromatic selectivity in all cases [24]. They also suggested that Ga-loaded H-ZSM-5 was better than the pure gallosilicate for propane aromatization."

[2] "Although the aforementioned studies assumed that the extra-framework Ga species were present in the zeolite pores, Ga oxide domains have also been found on the outer surface of zeolites upon calcination, with the oxide clusters being 310 nm in size [45]."

[3] "The authors suggested that the Si species in MPS are incorporated into the zeolite framework after hydrolysis of the trimethoxy groups while preserving the Si-mercaptopropyl linkage. At the same time, the thiol group on the 3-mercaptopropyl moiety interacts with metallic ions (such as Pt2+ or Cd2+) in the zeolite synthesis solution (or gel), thereby facilitating their occlusion in the zeolite pores during crystallization."
