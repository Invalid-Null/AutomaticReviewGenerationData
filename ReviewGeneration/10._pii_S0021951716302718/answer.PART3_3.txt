<quotes>

[1] "In an early report, Bayense et al. reported that the specific synthesis method used for Ga incorporation into HZSM-5 did not have much effect on the propane conversion, but incorporation of Ga increased the aromatic selectivity in all cases [24]. They also suggested that Ga-loaded H-ZSM-5 was better than the pure gallosilicate for propane aromatization."

[2] "Although the aforementioned studies assumed that the extra-framework Ga species were present in the zeolite pores, Ga oxide domains have also been found on the outer surface of zeolites upon calcination, with the oxide clusters being 310 nm in size [45]."

[3] "The authors suggested that the Si species in MPS are incorporated into the zeolite framework after hydrolysis of the trimethoxy groups while preserving the Si-mercaptopropyl linkage. At the same time, the thiol group on the 3-mercaptopropyl moiety interacts with metallic ions (such as Pt2+ or Cd2+) in the zeolite synthesis solution (or gel), thereby facilitating their occlusion in the zeolite pores during crystallization."

3. Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses using different synthesis methods to incorporate gallium into the framework or extra-framework species of HZSM-5 zeolites and finds that incorporation method affects catalytic performance. It also introduces using a silane additive (MPS) during synthesis to interact with gallium species and influence their speciation and location.
