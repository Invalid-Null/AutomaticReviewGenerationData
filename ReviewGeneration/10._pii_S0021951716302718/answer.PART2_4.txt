<quotes>
[1] "Ga-modified MFI zeolite catalysts have been widely used in the UOP/BP Cyclar dehydrocyclization process [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]."

[2] "In this study, gallosilicate MFI can also be obtained by isomorphous substitution of Ga in the MFI zeolite framework [32], [33], since Ga can be easily incorporated in the MFI framework."

[3] "The PDH selectivity of gallosilicate molecular sieves is known to be strongly affected by the concentration of strong Lewis acid sites, with the most effective catalysts having a small concentration of Brønsted acid sites coupled with strong Lewis acidity."

[4] "Therefore, the new gallosilicates prepared by MPS addition have acidities that are well-aligned with selective PDH catalysis."  

[5] "The reactivity of the catalysts prepared in the presence of MPS demonstrates that these catalysts are more effective for PDH than gallosilicate catalysts prepared without the MPS functional silane, having good propane conversion rates and higher selectivity to propylene."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates MFI zeolite support for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it investigates gallosilicate MFI zeolites where Ga is incorporated into the MFI framework via isomorphous substitution. The article notes that gallosilicate MFI zeolites with strong Lewis acid sites and lower Brønsted acid sites are effective for propane dehydrogenation. The new gallosilicate MFI catalysts prepared with MPS addition demonstrate higher propane conversion rates and propylene selectivity compared to those made without MPS.

答案:是的,文章评价了MFI沸石支持的丙烷脱氢催化剂。具体来说,它研究了通过同态取代将Ga掺入MFI框架的硅镓MFI沸石。文章指出,具有强Lewis酸位点和较少Brønsted酸位点的硅镓MFI沸石对于丙烷脱氢反应有效。与不含MPS制备的相比,新的用MPS添加制备的硅镓MFI催化剂表现出更高的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。
