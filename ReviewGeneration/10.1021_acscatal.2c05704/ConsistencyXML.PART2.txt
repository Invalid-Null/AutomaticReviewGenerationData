To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the key points and facts between each answer file and the correct answers. For questions 1-5, all the answer files had 100% consistent answers with the correct answers, stating that the article did not compare selectivity profiles, evaluate Pt alloys, investigate secondary metal effects, use subsurface promoters, or describe synergistic effects between metals.

For question 6, answer files PART2_0.txt and PART2_2.txt had slight inconsistencies or missing details compared to the very comprehensive correct answer, so I estimated their consistency at 90%. The other files were completely consistent for question 6.

For question 7, all files had fully consistent answers stating that effects of tuning Si/Al ratio and adding mesoporosity were not investigated. So they all received 100% consistency scores.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
