[1] "ZnO-based catalysts were synthesized as follows: 0.08 g of commercial ZnO (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.92 g of each support were physically mixed in a mortar for 10 min."
[2] "Additional catalysts were prepared according to a dual-bed method, as shown in Scheme 1. Typically, commercial ZnO (particles of 315710 μm) and the support (particles of 315710 μm) were loaded into a quartz tube (inner diameter of 6 mm) with ZnO being the top layer (upstream)."

[1] "To explore the nature of active sites in ZnOx-based catalysts, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra at the Zn K absorption edge were recorded at the P65 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg) in transmission mode."
[2] "The Fourier transformed k2-weighted extended X-ray adsorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra are presented in Figure 2b. The fitting results are summarized in Table 2 and Figure S3 in the Supporting Information."
