[1] "ZnO-containing catalysts based on, e.g., SiO2, (24) Al2O3, (25) ZrO2-based materials, (26,27) and zeolites, e.g., HZSM-5, (28,29) dealuminated (deAl) beta, (30) and silicalite-1 (S-1) (3135) were widely investigated."

[2] "To mimic their diffusion, force-field molecular dynamics (FFMD) simulations were employed at the reaction temperature (see Section 3.6)." 

[3] "The MFI zeolite possesses straight and sinusoidal channels with 10-member rings (Figure 1a). The pore sizes are 5.3 × 5.6 and 5.1 × 5.5 Å, respectively. The BEA zeolite has 3-dimensional intersecting 12-member rings (Figure 1b), which are larger than those in the MFI zeolite."

[4] "Under conditions free of any diffusion limitations, ZnOx clusters reveal higher Zn-related activity than binuclear ZnOx species."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
6. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates zeolite supports like MFI and BEA structures for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It investigates ZnOx species supported on MFI silicalite-1 with 10-member rings and BEA dealuminated beta zeolite with 12-member rings.

<quotes>
[1] "The morphology of ZrO2, S-1, and beta zeolite supports was established...and (ii) to control olefin selectivity through limited diffusion of the desired product."

[2] "ZnOdeAl beta reveals higher isobutene selectivity than the ZnOS-1(i) catalysts...the kind of ZnOx can be excluded as the reason for the difference in selectivity over these materials."

[3] "To explain the changes in the selectivity order between the ZnOdeAl beta and ZnOS-1(i) catalysts in PDH and iBDH...In the light of lower deactivation rate constant in the iBDH reaction over the ZnO-deAl beta catalyst in comparison with the PDH reaction (Table 3), more attention was paid to analyze coke selectivity."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
6. Answer: Yes, the article evaluates zeolite supports like S-1 (MFI) and beta (BEA) for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It investigates how the pore size and topology affect diffusion limitations and thus the selectivity to desired olefins vs coke and cracking products. The beta zeolite with 12-member rings shows less diffusion limitations for isobutene, leading to higher selectivity compared to S-1 with 10-member rings.
