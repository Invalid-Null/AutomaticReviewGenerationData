I carefully analyzed the quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers from each answer file to assess consistency with the correct answers provided. I assigned each answer a consistency percentage to quantify how consistent it was with the correct answer. The XML structure presents this percentage comparison for each question and answer file combination.
