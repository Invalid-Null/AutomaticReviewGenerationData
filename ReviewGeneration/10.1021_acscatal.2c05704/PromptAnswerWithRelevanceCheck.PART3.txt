[1] "ZnO-based catalysts were synthesized as follows: 0.08 g of commercial ZnO (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.92 g of each support were physically mixed in a mortar for 10 min."

[2] "For X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements (see Section 2.2), to exclude the effect of bulk ZnO present in the abovedescribed physical mixtures, additional catalysts were prepared according to a dual-bed method, as shown in Scheme 1." 

[3] "Encouraged by the requirements of environmental sustainability, many efforts have been made both in academia and industry to develop alternative supported or bulk DH catalysts based on oxides of V, (15,16) Ga, (17,18) Co, (19) Fe, (20,21) or Zr. (22,23) ZnO-containing catalysts based on, e.g., SiO2, (24) Al2O3, (25) ZrO2-based materials, (26,27) and zeolites, e.g., HZSM-5, (28,29) dealuminated (deAl) beta, (30) and silicalite-1 (S-1) (3135) were widely investigated."
