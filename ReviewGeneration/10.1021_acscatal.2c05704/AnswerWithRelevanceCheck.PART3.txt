[1] To avoid any effect from the bulk ZnO in the ZnOzeolite mixtures, additional catalysts were prepared according to the dual-bed reduction method using H2 as a reducing agent (Scheme 1 and the corresponding description in Section 2).  
[2] Except for the deAl beta support, a positively linear correlation between the activity and the amount of OH nests on S-1 supports was established (Figure S4c,d).

3. The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it prepares catalysts using a dual-bed reduction method to avoid effects from bulk ZnO in ZnO-zeolite mixtures. It also finds a correlation between activity and the amount of OH nests on S-1 supports, suggesting OH nests help disperse and optimize the active phase.

[1] To explore the nature of active sites in ZnOx-based catalysts, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra at the Zn K absorption edge were recorded at the P65 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg) in transmission mode except for the ZnOx/ZrO2 sample.
[2] The oxidation state of Zn in ZnOx/S-1(1), ZnOx/deAl beta, and ZnOx/ZrO2 is likely to be +2.  
[3] Binuclear ZnOx species and 3-dimensional multinuclear ZnOx clusters were in situ formed on the internal surface of silicalite-1 and deAl beta zeolite, respectively.

4. The article utilizes in-situ XANES and EXAFS at the Zn K-edge recorded at a synchrotron beamline to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It finds the Zn oxidation state is likely +2 during catalysis. It also distinguishes binuclear ZnOx species on silicalite-1 from 3D ZnOx clusters on deAl beta formed in-situ.
