<quotes>
[1] "The formation of isobutene through H abstraction from the i-butyl intermediate also needs a slightly higher energy than for the formation of propene from the primarily formed i-propyl intermediate, i.e., 1.34 vs 1.22 eV (i-TS2 and n-TS2 in Figure 5)."

[2] "Although it is easier to break the CH bonds in propane than in isobutane, the apparent barrier of the PDH reaction is higher than that of the iBDH reaction (1.81 vs 1.59 eV in Figure 5)."

Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation over the studied ZnO-based catalysts. It describes reaction steps like CH bond cleavage to form alkyl intermediates, H abstraction to form the olefin, and H2 formation and desorption. It also compares barriers for propane vs isobutane dehydrogenation.
