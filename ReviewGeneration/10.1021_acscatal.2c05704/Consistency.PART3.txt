I carefully compared the English and Chinese answers from each file to the correct answers provided for each question. I made a subjective judgement on the consistency percentage based on how well the answers matched the key points in the correct answers. The JSON structure summarizes the consistency ratios for each question-file pair. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the analysis.
