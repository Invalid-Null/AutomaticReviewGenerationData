[1] "ZnO-based catalysts were synthesized as follows: 0.08 g of commercial ZnO (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.92 g of each support were physically mixed in a mortar for 10 min."

[2] "For X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements (see Section 2.2), to exclude the effect of bulk ZnO present in the abovedescribed physical mixtures, additional catalysts were prepared according to a dual-bed method, as shown in Scheme 1." 

[3] "Encouraged by the requirements of environmental sustainability, many efforts have been made both in academia and industry to develop alternative supported or bulk DH catalysts based on oxides of V, (15,16) Ga, (17,18) Co, (19) Fe, (20,21) or Zr. (22,23) ZnO-containing catalysts based on, e.g., SiO2, (24) Al2O3, (25) ZrO2-based materials, (26,27) and zeolites, e.g., HZSM-5, (28,29) dealuminated (deAl) beta, (30) and silicalite-1 (S-1) (3135) were widely investigated."

3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes physically mixing ZnO and different supports like silica, alumina, zirconia, and zeolites to synthesize ZnO-based catalysts. It also utilizes a dual-bed method to prepare catalysts for XAS measurements, to exclude the effect of bulk ZnO. Previous works investigating various metal oxide catalysts for dehydrogenation are also mentioned.

[1] "To explore the nature of active sites in ZnOx-based catalysts, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra at the Zn K absorption edge were recorded at the P65 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg) in transmission mode except for the ZnOx/ZrO2 sample."

[2] "The first and second shell scatterings at 1.5 and 2.9 Å (3.2 Å for the ZnOx/ZrO2 sample, uncorrected distance) correspond to O and Zn neighbors as in ZnO, respectively."

[3] "Regardless of the zeolite morphology, catalytically active ZnOx species are formed inside the pores. Binuclear ZnOx species and 3-dimensional multinuclear ZnOx clusters were in situ formed on the internal surface of silicalite-1 and deAl beta zeolite, respectively. The external surface of ZrO2 is populated by binuclear ZnOx species differing from those in silicalite-1."

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS) to study the nature of active sites in working ZnO-based propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It reveals that binuclear ZnOx species and 3D multinuclear ZnOx clusters are formed inside the pores of silicalite-1 and dealuminated beta zeolite supports, respectively, while binuclear ZnOx species are formed on the external surface of ZrO2.

[1] "The position of the adsorption edge in the obtained XANES spectra of all as-prepared samples is about 9662 eV (Figure 2a), which is close to that of ZnO. Thus, the oxidation state of Zn in ZnOx/S-1(1), ZnOx/deAl beta, and ZnOx/ZrO2 is likely to be +2."
