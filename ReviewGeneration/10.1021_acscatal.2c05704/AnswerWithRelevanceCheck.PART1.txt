 Unfortunately upon review, I do not find any quotes in the provided answers that are directly relevant to answering the specific questions asked. The answers indicate that the literature discussed focuses solely on ZnO-based catalysts for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation, and does not evaluate the other catalysts or mechanisms asked about in the questions.

Therefore, I will respond with:
