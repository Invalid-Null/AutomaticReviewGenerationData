<quotes>
[1] "Encouraged by the requirements of environmental sustainability, many efforts have been made both in academia and industry to develop alternative supported or bulk DH catalysts based on oxides of V, (15,16) Ga, (17,18) Co, (19) Fe, (20,21) or Zr. (22,23)" 

[2] "Against the above background, our present intentions are to explore (i) the effect of the topology of a support on catalyst activity and product selectivity and (ii) the efficiency of catalysts used in PDH and iBDH."

[3] "We initially validated our approach by comparing simulated and experimental diffusivity values. The simulated diffusion coefficients of propane and isobutane within the MFI framework at 60 °C agree well with those determined experimentally in refs (60) and (61) at the same temperature (Table S4 and Figure S12a). Thus, our simulations at 550 °C (Figure S12b,c) should also be reliable."

[4] "To consider the flexibility of the zeolite framework, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were applied."

 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the literature that directly address the questions asked. The article is focused on analyzing the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of different ZnOx species supported on silicalite-1, dealuminated beta zeolite, and ZrO2 for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation reactions. It does not discuss process intensification, techno-economic analysis, safety issues, remaining challenges/knowledge gaps, high-throughput computational catalyst screening, improved characterization tools, or transformational catalyst architectures specifically for propane dehydrogenation.
