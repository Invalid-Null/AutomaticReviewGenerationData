 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes in the literature provided that are directly relevant to answering the questions asked. The literature focuses on the catalytic activity of zinc oxide species supported on different zeolite frameworks for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation reactions. It does not provide background on the industrial importance of propylene, mechanisms of catalyst activity, thermodynamic and kinetic factors, or computational modeling of propane dehydrogenation specifically.
