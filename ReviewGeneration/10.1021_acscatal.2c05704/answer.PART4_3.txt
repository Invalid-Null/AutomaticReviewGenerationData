 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the literature that directly address the questions asked. The article is focused on analyzing the catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of different ZnOx species supported on silicalite-1, dealuminated beta zeolite, and ZrO2 for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation reactions. It does not discuss process intensification, techno-economic analysis, safety issues, remaining challenges/knowledge gaps, high-throughput computational catalyst screening, improved characterization tools, or transformational catalyst architectures specifically for propane dehydrogenation.
