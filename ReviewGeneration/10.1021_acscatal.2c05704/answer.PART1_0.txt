 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that directly answer the questions asked. The article does not evaluate Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 or any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir for propane dehydrogenation. It also does not investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts. No mechanistic pathways are proposed for propane dehydrogenation over supported metal catalysts.

The article focuses on investigating ZnO-containing catalysts supported on silicalite-1, dealuminated beta zeolite and ZrO2 for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation. It studies how the structure and morphology of the supports affect the nature and performance of the formed ZnOx species. It also analyzes diffusion limitations and shape selectivity effects imposed by the microporous zeolite structures. Detailed mechanistic pathways are provided for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation over binuclear ZnOx species. But overall, none of the questions can be directly answered using quotes from the given literature.
