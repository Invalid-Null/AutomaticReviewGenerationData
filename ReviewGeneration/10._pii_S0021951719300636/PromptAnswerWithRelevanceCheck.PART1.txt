Answer: No, the article does not evaluate Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 or other promising metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses solely on monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 catalysts.

Answer: No, the article does not investigate how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It only studies the effect of crystallite size and phase composition (monoclinic vs tetragonal) of ZrO2.
</English version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "Two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy, i.e. coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) having, nevertheless, different chemical environment in tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2, were concluded to be responsible for homolytic breaking of CH bonds in propane." 

[2] "After identifying the mode of methylene CH activation, we examined several possible routes of methyl CH bond activation in iso-C3H7 adsorbed on the Zr6cIa or Zr6cII site."

[3] "the defective t-ZrO2(101) surface in our model was created through removal of one O3cI species"

[4] "Regardless of the catalysts tested, the Ea values were about 150 kJ·mol1. The similarity between differently structured ZrO2 in terms of experimentally determined Ea values suggests that the kind of the active site does not depend on catalyst phase composition. It can be composed of two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy as concluded from DFT calculations."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article does propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the ZrO2 catalysts studied. According to DFT calculations, two coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) located at an oxygen vacancy are responsible for homolytically breaking the C-H bonds in propane (Quote 1). The methyl C-H bond in the resulting isopropyl intermediate is then broken to form propene (Quote 2). The creation of oxygen vacancies through removal of oxygen species is also described (Quote 3). Experimentally determined activation energies also suggest that the active site is composed of two Zrcus cations, regardless of ZrO2 phase (Quote 4).
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文确实提出了在所研究的ZrO2催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢的机理场景。根据DFT计算,两个位于氧空位的非饱和配位的锆阳离子(Zrcus)能够均裂丙烷中的C-H键(引文1)。生成的异丙基中间体中的甲基C-H键然后断裂形成丙烯(引文2)。文章还描述了通过去除氧原子形成氧空位的过程(引文3)。从实验确定的活化能也提示,无论ZrO2的相组成如何,活性位点都由两个Zrcus阳离子组成(引文4)。

It can be composed of two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy as concluded from DFT calculations."

2. "Monoclinic ZrO2 showed, however, higher rate of propene formation and higher propene selectivity than ZrO2 stabilized in the tetragonal phase. Both the activity and the selectivity to propene increased with a decrease in the size of crystallites." 

3. "Such difference between t-ZrO2 (101) and m-ZrO2 (110) might be related to the local structure of two Zrcus cations forming the active site on these surfaces."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how phase composition (monoclinic vs tetragonal) and crystallite size affect the oxidation state, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of ZrO2 for propane dehydrogenation. It shows monoclinic ZrO2 has higher activity and propene selectivity compared to tetragonal ZrO2, attributed to easier oxygen removal and higher density of coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites in monoclinic ZrO2. Both monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 display increased activity and selectivity with decreasing crystallite size, related to increased oxygen vacancies and mobility. 
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章研究了相组成(单斜相对四方)和晶粒大小如何影响ZrO2的氧化态、氧的移动性和酸碱性质以进行丙烷脱氢。它显示单斜ZrO2比四方ZrO2具有更高的活性和丙烯选择性,这归因于单斜ZrO2更容易释放氧和具有更高的无配位Zr位点密度。单斜和四方ZrO2随着晶粒大小的减小都显示出增加的活性和选择性,这与氧空穴和移动性的增加有关。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

1. "It is obvious from Fig. 1 and Fig. S5 that the energy profiles in the course of propane dehydrogenation reaction over oxygen-defective m-ZrO2(110) and oxygen-defective t-ZrO2(101) have the same shape and trend."

2. "Regardless of the phase composition of ZrO2, two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy, which has different local environment in t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2, are responsible for propane activation, while catalytic centers consisting of one lattice oxygen and one saturated Zr site or two lattice oxygen species do not seem to be relevant."

3. "After identifying the mode of methylene CH activation, we examined several possible routes of methyl CH bond activation in iso-C3H7 adsorbed on the Zr6cIa or Zr6cII site (Fig. S6). The most thermodynamically and kinetically preferred route is methyl CH bond dissociation at the (Zr6cII, Zr6cIa)-Ov site with the dissociated H located at the adjacent Zr6cIa center (Fig. 1 and Fig. S6)."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes detailed mechanistic reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 catalysts. It describes homolytic C-H bond cleavage occurring on two coordinatively unsaturated Zr sites neighboring an oxygen vacancy to form an iso-C3H7 intermediate. Further C-H cleavage forms propene. The active sites differ slightly between monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 but lead to similar overall reaction pathways.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章为单斜和四方ZrO2催化剂上的丙烷脱氢提出了详细的机理反应途径。它描述了发生在邻近氧空穴的两个无配位Zr位点上的CH键同裂,形成一个异丙基中间体。进一步的CH键裂解形成丙烯。单斜和四方ZrO2上的活性位点有略微不同,但导致相似的整体反应途径。
