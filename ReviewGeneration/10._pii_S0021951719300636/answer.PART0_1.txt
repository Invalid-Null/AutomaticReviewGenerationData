[1] Propene formation over m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2 occurs on two Zrcus cations, however, the phase composition of ZrO2 is nevertheless relevant for the PDH reaction as concluded from the potential energy surfaces shown in Fig. 1 and the Gibbs free energy profiles in Fig. S5.

[2] DFT calculations predict that two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy, which has different local environment in t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2, are responsible for propane activation, while catalytic centers consisting of one lattice oxygen and one saturated Zr site or two lattice oxygen species do not seem to be relevant.

4. The article discusses that propane dehydrogenation is thermodynamically limited, as propene formation and hydrogen formation are endothermic processes according to DFT calculations. Kinetically, the calculations show that hydrogen formation has the highest activation barrier and is likely the rate-limiting step. The phase composition of ZrO2 affects the thermodynamics and kinetics, with m-ZrO2 being more active than t-ZrO2.

[1] To identify the kind of active site and the mode of dissociation of methylene CH bond over defective t-ZrO2 (101), we computed the reaction on three different sites: (i) one lattice oxygen and one saturated Zr site (Zr6cIa-O3cI, Zr6cIa-O3cII, Zr6cIIO3cII, Zr7cIO3cI or Zr7cIO3cII in Fig. S1 (a)), (ii) two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy ([Zr6cIa, Zr6cII]-Ov or [Zr6cII, Zr6cIb]-Ov in Fig. S1 (b)) and (iii) two lattice oxygen species (O3cIO3cII in Fig S1 (a)). 

[2] The most thermodynamically preferable pathway was concluded to be homolytic breaking of the C-H bond on the [Zr6cIa, Zr6cII]-Ov or [Zr6cII, Zr6cIb]-Ov sites (Fig. 1, Fig. S3, Table S3), which is exothermic by 0.91 or 0.29eV (Fig. S4).

5. The article describes how DFT calculations were applied to study the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation over defective tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2 surfaces. The calculations predicted that two coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy are the active sites responsible for homolytic breaking of the C-H bond in propane, which is the first step in the reaction mechanism.

[1] Regardless of the catalysts tested, the Ea values were about 150 kJ·mol1. The similarity between differently structured ZrO2 in terms of experimentally determined Ea values suggests that the kind of the active site does not depend on catalyst phase composition.

[2] The rate of propene formation over the t-ZrO2 materials increases with a decrease in crystallite size. However, there should be a minimal size of crystallites, below which ZrO2 will lose its high PDH activity as concluded from the fact that the rate of propene formation on a-ZrO2 was low (Fig. 4(a)). 

[3] Monoclinic ZrO2 showed, however, higher rate of propene formation and higher propene selectivity than ZrO2 stabilized in the tetragonal phase.

7. The article describes experimental work identifying the crystallite size and phase composition of ZrO2 as descriptors that correlate with propane dehydrogenation performance. Smaller monoclinic ZrO2 crystallites were found to have higher activity and propylene selectivity compared to larger monoclinic or tetragonal crystallites. There is also an optimal crystallite size, below which activity decreases.
