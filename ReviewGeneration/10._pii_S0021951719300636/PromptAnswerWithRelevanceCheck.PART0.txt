[1] "Propene is widely used for the manufacture of a large number of chemicals relevant for our everyday life [1], [2]. Its production and demand continue to grow because of the higher consumption of the downstream products made of propene." 

[2] "Propene is mainly produced through steam (6065%) or fluid catalytic cracking (30%) of various oil fractions [5], [6]. However, these two processes cannot fulfill the demands for propene."

[3] "PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively [3]."

[4] "Such catalysts are highly active and selective, however, have some drawbacks [3], [9], [10], [11]. In particular, Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species [3], while Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."

<English version answer>

1. The article provides background that propylene is widely used to manufacture many important chemicals and its demand is increasing due to high consumption of downstream propylene products. It states that currently 60-65% of propylene is produced from steam cracking and 30% from fluid catalytic cracking of oil fractions, but these processes cannot meet increasing demand. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important on-purpose propylene production route with high selectivity, with the main industrial processes utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts.  

2. The article explains that catalysts like CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 lower the activation energy barriers for propane dehydrogenation to occur. It does not go into details about specific mechanisms by which this occurs.

3. The article introduces CrOx/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, and ZrO2 as catalysts explored for propane dehydrogenation. It also briefly mentions catalysts based on ZnO, GaOx, VOx, isolated FeII, and CoII. No details are provided about supported metals, alloys, or zeolites.

4. The article does not discuss thermodynamic constraints or provide quantitative kinetic details about propane dehydrogenation. 

5. The article describes using DFT calculations to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways over defective monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 surfaces. The calculations suggest dehydrogenation occurs on two Zr cation sites neighboring an oxygen vacancy, with higher barriers on tetragonal ZrO2.

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation kinetics.

7. The article describes computational and experimental work correlating ZrO2 crystallite size and phase (monoclinic vs tetragonal) to propane dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. Smaller monoclinic crystallites show higher activity and propene selectivity due to higher concentration of proposed active sites.

[1] Propene formation over m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2 occurs on two Zrcus cations, however, the phase composition of ZrO2 is nevertheless relevant for the PDH reaction as concluded from the potential energy surfaces shown in Fig. 1 and the Gibbs free energy profiles in Fig. S5.

[2] DFT calculations predict that two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy, which has different local environment in t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2, are responsible for propane activation, while catalytic centers consisting of one lattice oxygen and one saturated Zr site or two lattice oxygen species do not seem to be relevant.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

4. The article discusses that propane dehydrogenation is thermodynamically limited, as propene formation and hydrogen formation are endothermic processes according to DFT calculations. Kinetically, the calculations show that hydrogen formation has the highest activation barrier and is likely the rate-limiting step. The phase composition of ZrO2 affects the thermodynamics and kinetics, with m-ZrO2 being more active than t-ZrO2.

4. 文章讨论了丙烷脱氢在热力学上是受限的,因为根据 DFT 计算,丙烯形成和氢形成都是放热过程。在动力学方面,计算显示氢形成具有最高的活化能垒,可能是速率控制步骤。ZrO2的相组成影响热力学和动力学,m-ZrO2比t-ZrO2更活跃。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] To identify the kind of active site and the mode of dissociation of methylene CH bond over defective t-ZrO2 (101), we computed the reaction on three different sites: (i) one lattice oxygen and one saturated Zr site (Zr6cIa-O3cI, Zr6cIa-O3cII, Zr6cIIO3cII, Zr7cIO3cI or Zr7cIO3cII in Fig. S1 (a)), (ii) two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy ([Zr6cIa, Zr6cII]-Ov or [Zr6cII, Zr6cIb]-Ov in Fig. S1 (b)) and (iii) two lattice oxygen species (O3cIO3cII in Fig S1 (a)). 

[2] The most thermodynamically preferable pathway was concluded to be homolytic breaking of the C-H bond on the [Zr6cIa, Zr6cII]-Ov or [Zr6cII, Zr6cIb]-Ov sites (Fig. 1, Fig. S3, Table S3), which is exothermic by 0.91 or 0.29eV (Fig. S4).

<English version answer>

5. The article describes how DFT calculations were applied to study the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation over defective tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2 surfaces. The calculations predicted that two coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy are the active sites responsible for homolytic breaking of the C-H bond in propane, which is the first step in the reaction mechanism.

[1] Regardless of the catalysts tested, the Ea values were about 150 kJ·mol1. The similarity between differently structured ZrO2 in terms of experimentally determined Ea values suggests that the kind of the active site does not depend on catalyst phase composition.

[2] The rate of propene formation over the t-ZrO2 materials increases with a decrease in crystallite size. However, there should be a minimal size of crystallites, below which ZrO2 will lose its high PDH activity as concluded from the fact that the rate of propene formation on a-ZrO2 was low (Fig. 4(a)). 

[3] Monoclinic ZrO2 showed, however, higher rate of propene formation and higher propene selectivity than ZrO2 stabilized in the tetragonal phase.

</quotes>

<English version answer>

7. The article describes experimental work identifying the crystallite size and phase composition of ZrO2 as descriptors that correlate with propane dehydrogenation performance. Smaller monoclinic ZrO2 crystallites were found to have higher activity and propylene selectivity compared to larger monoclinic or tetragonal crystallites. There is also an optimal crystallite size, below which activity decreases.

1. Propene is widely used for the manufacture of a large number of chemicals relevant for our everyday life [1], [2]. Its production and demand continue to grow because of the higher consumption of the downstream products made of propene. The global annual propene market is estimated to reach 165 million tons by 2030 compared to 103 million in 2012 [3], [4]. 

2. Nowadays, propene is mainly produced through steam (6065%) or fluid catalytic cracking (30%) of various oil fractions [5], [6]. However, these two processes cannot fulfill the demands for propene. Therefore, some on-purpose technologies, such as metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes [7], methanol to olefins or propene [8] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3] have been developed to close the gap between propene demand and production.

3. PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively [3]. 

4. Such catalysts are highly active and selective, however, have some drawbacks [3], [9], [10], [11]. In particular, Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species [3], while Cr(VI) may cause various health effects. Apart from Pt-based or CrOx-based catalysts, there are some alternatives reported in literature. They include materials on the basis of ZnO [12], [13], [14], GaOx [15], [16], VOx [17], [18], [19], isolated FeII [20] and CoII [21].

5. Spin-polarized and periodic DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [27], [28]. To identify the kind of active site and the mode of dissociation of methylene CH bond over defective t-ZrO2 (101), we computed the reaction on three different sites: (i) one lattice oxygen and one saturated Zr site (Zr6cIa-O3cI, Zr6cIa-O3cII, Zr6cIIO3cII, Zr7cIO3cI or Zr7cIO3cII in Fig. S1 (a)), (ii) two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy ([Zr6cIa, Zr6cII]-Ov or [Zr6cII, Zr6cIb]-Ov in Fig. S1 (b)) and (iii) two lattice oxygen species (O3cIO3cII in Fig S1 (a)). 

6. The Climbing Image Nudged Elastic Band (CI-NEB) method with eight images was applied for finding transition states and minimum energy paths of all reactions with a force tolerance of 0.05eV/Å [30]. The normal mode frequency analysis was performed to validate the optimized transition states and each authentic transition state has only one imaginary frequency along the reaction coordinates.

Therefore, technologies like propane dehydrogenation have been developed to increase propylene supply.

[2] "Among all t-ZrO2 surfaces, the (101) termination with O-Zr-O surface was found to be most stable [35], [36], [37]. The t-ZrO2(101) surface was modelled by a nine-layer slab with the lowest three layers fixed in the bulk positions and the upper six layers being allowed to relax. In all cases, a p(2×3) lateral supercell containing a vacuum space of 15Å between the slab and its periodic replicas was used. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 3×3×1 MonkhorstPack mesh."

[3] "The adsorption energy is defined by Eads=EX+s/dEs/dEX, where EX+s/d is the total energy of the slab (clean or oxygen defect surface) with adsorbents in its equilibrium geometry, Es/d is the total energy of the slab (clean or oxygen defect surface) and EX is gas-phase species. The more negative the adsorption energy, the stronger the adsorption is. The activation barrier (or activation energy, Ea) and reaction energy (ΔEr) are calculated according to Ea=ETSEIS and ΔEr=EFSEIS, where EIS, EFS and ETS are the energies of the corresponding initial state (IS), final state (FS) and transition state (TS) respectively."
