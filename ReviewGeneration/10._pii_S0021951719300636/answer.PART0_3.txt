1. Propene is widely used for the manufacture of a large number of chemicals relevant for our everyday life [1], [2]. Its production and demand continue to grow because of the higher consumption of the downstream products made of propene. The global annual propene market is estimated to reach 165 million tons by 2030 compared to 103 million in 2012 [3], [4]. 

2. Nowadays, propene is mainly produced through steam (6065%) or fluid catalytic cracking (30%) of various oil fractions [5], [6]. However, these two processes cannot fulfill the demands for propene. Therefore, some on-purpose technologies, such as metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes [7], methanol to olefins or propene [8] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3] have been developed to close the gap between propene demand and production.

3. PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively [3]. 

4. Such catalysts are highly active and selective, however, have some drawbacks [3], [9], [10], [11]. In particular, Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species [3], while Cr(VI) may cause various health effects. Apart from Pt-based or CrOx-based catalysts, there are some alternatives reported in literature. They include materials on the basis of ZnO [12], [13], [14], GaOx [15], [16], VOx [17], [18], [19], isolated FeII [20] and CoII [21].

5. Spin-polarized and periodic DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [27], [28]. To identify the kind of active site and the mode of dissociation of methylene CH bond over defective t-ZrO2 (101), we computed the reaction on three different sites: (i) one lattice oxygen and one saturated Zr site (Zr6cIa-O3cI, Zr6cIa-O3cII, Zr6cIIO3cII, Zr7cIO3cI or Zr7cIO3cII in Fig. S1 (a)), (ii) two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy ([Zr6cIa, Zr6cII]-Ov or [Zr6cII, Zr6cIb]-Ov in Fig. S1 (b)) and (iii) two lattice oxygen species (O3cIO3cII in Fig S1 (a)). 

6. The Climbing Image Nudged Elastic Band (CI-NEB) method with eight images was applied for finding transition states and minimum energy paths of all reactions with a force tolerance of 0.05eV/Å [30]. The normal mode frequency analysis was performed to validate the optimized transition states and each authentic transition state has only one imaginary frequency along the reaction coordinates.

1. The article provides background that propylene is widely used to manufacture many chemicals, and its global demand is estimated to reach 165 million tons by 2030, significantly higher than 103 million tons in 2012. Propylene is mainly produced by steam or catalytic cracking of oil fractions, but these cannot meet demands. Therefore, technologies like propane dehydrogenation have been developed to increase propylene supply.

2. The article explains catalysts like CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 lower activation energy barriers in propane dehydrogenation and are highly active and selective. But Pt is expensive and Cr has health risks. Alternatives like metal oxides and zeolites have been explored.

3. The article introduces catalysts studied for propane dehydrogenation including metal oxides like ZnO, GaOx, VOx, and zeolites. Commercial catalysts are CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3.

4. The article does not provide quantitative details on thermodynamics or kinetics of propane dehydrogenation.

5. The article describes using DFT calculations with VASP to study mechanisms and active sites for propane dehydrogenation on ZrO2 surfaces. Calculations identified Zr cations at oxygen vacancies as active sites.

6. The article does not present microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation kinetics.

7. The article does not describe computational or experimental work identifying catalyst descriptors correlated to propane dehydrogenation performance.
