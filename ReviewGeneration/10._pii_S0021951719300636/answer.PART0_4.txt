[1] "To identify the kind of active site and the mode of dissociation of methylene CH bond over defective t-ZrO2 (101), we computed the reaction on three different sites: (i) one lattice oxygen and one saturated Zr site (Zr6cIa-O3cI, Zr6cIa-O3cII, Zr6cIIO3cII, Zr7cIO3cI or Zr7cIO3cII in Fig. S1 (a)), (ii) two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy ([Zr6cIa, Zr6cII]-Ov or [Zr6cII, Zr6cIb]-Ov in Fig. S1 (b)) and (iii) two lattice oxygen species (O3cIO3cII in Fig S1 (a))."

[2] "Among all t-ZrO2 surfaces, the (101) termination with O-Zr-O surface was found to be most stable [35], [36], [37]. The t-ZrO2(101) surface was modelled by a nine-layer slab with the lowest three layers fixed in the bulk positions and the upper six layers being allowed to relax. In all cases, a p(2×3) lateral supercell containing a vacuum space of 15Å between the slab and its periodic replicas was used. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 3×3×1 MonkhorstPack mesh."

[3] "The adsorption energy is defined by Eads=EX+s/dEs/dEX, where EX+s/d is the total energy of the slab (clean or oxygen defect surface) with adsorbents in its equilibrium geometry, Es/d is the total energy of the slab (clean or oxygen defect surface) and EX is gas-phase species. The more negative the adsorption energy, the stronger the adsorption is. The activation barrier (or activation energy, Ea) and reaction energy (ΔEr) are calculated according to Ea=ETSEIS and ΔEr=EFSEIS, where EIS, EFS and ETS are the energies of the corresponding initial state (IS), final state (FS) and transition state (TS) respectively."

Answer: The article describes how DFT calculations have been applied to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways over defective tetragonal ZrO2 (101). The calculations identified that two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy are the active site for homolytic breaking of the CH bond in propane. The calculations also determined the activation barriers and reaction energies for individual steps in propane dehydrogenation. The tetragonal ZrO2 (101) surface was modeled using a slab approach with details provided on the simulation parameters.
