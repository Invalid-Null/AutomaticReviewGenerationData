 Based on the provided correct answers and comparative answer documents, here is the comparative analysis in the requested JSON format:

{
  "1": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "50%"},
  "2": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "50%"}, 
  "3": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "0%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "0%"},
  "4": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer0.txt": "100%", "answer1.txt": "100%", "answer2.txt": "100%", "answer3.txt": "100%", "answer4.txt": "100%"}
}

To generate this, I compared each answer file's responses for each question to the correct answer provided. I calculated a consistency percentage based on semantic similarity of the key ideas and facts. 100% indicates the file's answer conveyed all the key information in the correct answer, while 0% indicates no overlap in content and meaning.
