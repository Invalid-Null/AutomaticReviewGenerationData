[1] "To identify the kind of active site and the mode of dissociation of methylene CH bond over defective t-ZrO2 (101), we computed the reaction on three different sites: (i) one lattice oxygen and one saturated Zr site (Zr6cIa-O3cI, Zr6cIIO3cII, Zr7cIO3cI or Zr7cIO3cII in Fig. S1 (a)), (ii) two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy ([Zr6cIa, Zr6cII]-Ov or [Zr6cII, Zr6cIb]-Ov in Fig. S1 (b)) and (iii) two lattice oxygen species (O3cIO3cII in Fig S1 (a)). The most thermodynamically preferable pathway was concluded to be homolytic breaking of the C-H bond on the [Zr6cIa, Zr6cII]-Ov or [Zr6cII, Zr6cIb]-Ov sites (Fig. 1, Fig. S3, Table S3), which is exothermic by 0.91 or 0.29eV (Fig. S4)."

[2] "As seen in Fig. 1 and Fig. S5 that the energy profiles in the course of propane dehydrogenation reaction over oxygen-defective m-ZrO2(
11) and oxygen-defective t-ZrO2(101) have the same shape and trend." 

[3] "Regardless of the catalysts tested, the Ea values were about 150 kJ·mol1. The similarity between differently structured ZrO2 in terms of experimentally determined Ea values suggests that the kind of the active site does not depend on catalyst phase composition. It can be composed of two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy as concluded from DFT calculations."

5. The article describes how DFT calculations have been applied to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways. Specifically, it discusses calculations done to identify the active site for propane dehydrogenation on tetragonal ZrO2 as two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy, based on the most thermodynamically favorable pathway for homolytic C-H bond breaking. It also shows through DFT that the energy profiles are similar for propane dehydrogenation over monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2.
