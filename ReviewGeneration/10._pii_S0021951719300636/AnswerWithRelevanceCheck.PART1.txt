           Answer: No, the article does not investigate how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It only studies the effects of crystallite size and crystal phase (monoclinic vs tetragonal) of ZrO2.

           [1] "Two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy, i.e. coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) having, nevertheless, different chemical environment in tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2, were concluded to be responsible for homolytic breaking of CH bonds in propane."
           
           [2] "After identifying the mode of methylene CH activation, we examined several possible routes of methyl CH bond activation in iso-C3H7 adsorbed on the Zr6cIa or Zr6cII site."
           
           [3] "the defective t-ZrO2(101) surface in our model was created through removal of one O3cI species"
           
           [4] "Regardless of the catalysts tested, the Ea values were about 150 kJ·mol1. The similarity between differently structured ZrO2 in terms of experimentally determined Ea values suggests that the kind of the active site does not depend on catalyst phase composition. It can be composed of two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy as concluded from DFT calculations."

           Answer: Yes, the article does propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the ZrO2 catalysts studied. According to DFT calculations, two coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) located at an oxygen vacancy are responsible for homolytically breaking the C-H bonds in propane (Quote 1). The methyl C-H bond in the resulting isopropyl intermediate is then broken to form propene (Quote 2). The creation of oxygen vacancies through removal of oxygen species is also described (Quote 3). Experimentally determined activation energies also suggest that the active site is composed of two Zrcus cations, regardless of ZrO2 phase (Quote 4).

           答:是的,本文确实提出了在所研究的ZrO2催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢的机理场景。根据DFT计算,两个位于氧空位的非饱和配位的锆阳离子(Zrcus)能够均裂丙烷中的C-H键(引文1)。生成的异丙基中间体中的甲基C-H键然后断裂形成丙烯(引文2)。文章还描述了通过去除氧原子形成氧空位的过程(引文3)。从实验确定的活化能也提示,无论ZrO2的相组成如何,活性位点都由两个Zrcus阳离子组成(引文4)。
