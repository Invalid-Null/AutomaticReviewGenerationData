 Unfortunately this literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the questions provided. The questions are about techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports, metal encapsulation in zeolite supports, optimizing active phase dispersion, in-situ characterization of propane dehydrogenation catalysts, microscopy characterization of metal-support interfaces, X-ray techniques for probing oxidation state changes, and evaluating different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation. However, the literature focuses on the effects of crystallite size and phase composition of zirconia catalysts on their activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss any of the topics asked about in the questions.
