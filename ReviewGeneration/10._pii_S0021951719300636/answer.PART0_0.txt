[1] "Propene is widely used for the manufacture of a large number of chemicals relevant for our everyday life [1], [2]. Its production and demand continue to grow because of the higher consumption of the downstream products made of propene." 

[2] "Propene is mainly produced through steam (6065%) or fluid catalytic cracking (30%) of various oil fractions [5], [6]. However, these two processes cannot fulfill the demands for propene."

[3] "PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively [3]."

[4] "Such catalysts are highly active and selective, however, have some drawbacks [3], [9], [10], [11]. In particular, Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species [3], while Cr(VI) may cause various health effects."

1. The article provides background that propylene is widely used to manufacture many important chemicals and its demand is increasing due to high consumption of downstream propylene products. It states that currently 60-65% of propylene is produced from steam cracking and 30% from fluid catalytic cracking of oil fractions, but these processes cannot meet increasing demand. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important on-purpose propylene production route with high selectivity, with the main industrial processes utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts.  

2. The article explains that catalysts like CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 lower the activation energy barriers for propane dehydrogenation to occur. It does not go into details about specific mechanisms by which this occurs.

3. The article introduces CrOx/Al2O3, Pt/Al2O3, and ZrO2 as catalysts explored for propane dehydrogenation. It also briefly mentions catalysts based on ZnO, GaOx, VOx, isolated FeII, and CoII. No details are provided about supported metals, alloys, or zeolites.

4. The article does not discuss thermodynamic constraints or provide quantitative kinetic details about propane dehydrogenation. 

5. The article describes using DFT calculations to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways over defective monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 surfaces. The calculations suggest dehydrogenation occurs on two Zr cation sites neighboring an oxygen vacancy, with higher barriers on tetragonal ZrO2.

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation kinetics.

7. The article describes computational and experimental work correlating ZrO2 crystallite size and phase (monoclinic vs tetragonal) to propane dehydrogenation activity and selectivity. Smaller monoclinic crystallites show higher activity and propene selectivity due to higher concentration of proposed active sites.

1. 该文提供了丙烯被广泛用于制造许多重要化学品的背景知识,以及其需求因下游丙烯产品的高消费而增长。它指出目前60-65%的丙烯来自蒸汽裂解,30%来自各种石油馏分的流化催化裂解,但这些过程不能满足日益增长的需求。丙烷脱氢(PDH)是一种重要的正丙烯生产途径,选择性高,其主要工业过程使用CrOx/Al2O3 和Pt/Al2O3 催化剂。

2. 该文解释了CrOx/Al2O3和Pt/Al2O3等催化剂能够降低丙烷脱氢所需的活化能垒。但没有详细讨论这通过什么具体机制发生的。

3. 该文提到了CrOx/Al2O3、Pt/Al2O3和ZrO2等被研究过的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它还简要提到了基于ZnO、GaOx、VOx、离子态FeII和CoII的催化剂。没有提供有关载体金属、合金或分子筛的详细信息。

4. 该文没有讨论丙烷脱氢的热力学约束条件,也没有提供定量的动力学细节。

5. 该文描述了使用DFT计算研究单斜和四方ZrO2表面的缺陷结构对丙烷脱氢机理和途径的影响。计算结果表明脱氢发生在氧空位邻近的两个Zr阳离子位点上,四方ZrO2的能垒更高。

6. 该文没有提供任何丙烷脱氢微观动力学建模。 

7. 该文描述了计算和实验工作,将ZrO2的结晶尺寸和相(单斜相与四方相)与丙烷脱氢活性和选择性相联系。较小的单斜ZrO2结晶体具有更高的活性和丙烯选择性,这可能与较高浓度的活性位点有关。
