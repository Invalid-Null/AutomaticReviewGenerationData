[1] "Fig. 9(a) shows the Pt 4f XPS profiles. The peaks at 71.3 and 74.6 eV are attributed to Pt0, and that at 78.4 eV arises from Pt4+ species." 

[2] "The Sn 3d5/2 XPS profiles are shown in Fig. 9(b). Peak resolution gave three peaks at around 485.6, 486.5, and 487.2 eV, which were assigned to different Sn species."
