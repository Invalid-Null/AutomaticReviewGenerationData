<quotes>
[1] "The Pt-based catalysts were prepared using an incipient wetness impregnation method." 

[2] "Simultaneous incorporation of Sn facilitated the distribution of Sn species in the silica framework."

[3] "Enhanced interactions between Sn species and the support suppress the reduction of Sn species and stabilize the oxidation states of Sn, and this encourages the development of M2 sites."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
3. Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it evaluates an incipient wetness impregnation method and a one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method for incorporating tin into a silica SBA-15 support. The one-pot method is found to provide better tin dispersion and interaction with the support compared to impregnation.

[1] "TEM was performed using a JEOL JEM 2010 electron microscope operated at 120.0 kV."

[2] "Fig. 8 shows TEM images of the reduced catalysts. The images show that all the samples had well-ordered mesoporous structures, with hexagonally arranged pores, indicating that the samples had the two-dimensional p6mm hexagonal structure."

[3] "The changes in the surface morphologies of the catalysts after the catalytic performance tests were investigated using TEM."
