[1] "The Pt-based catalysts were prepared using an incipient wetness impregnation method." 

[2] "Simultaneous incorporation of Sn facilitated the distribution of Sn species in the silica framework."

[3] "Enhanced interactions between Sn species and the support suppress the reduction of Sn species and stabilize the oxidation states of Sn, and this encourages the development of M2 sites."

[1] "The catalytic performances of these catalysts were compared with that of a catalyst prepared using a conventional impregnation method."

[2] "The Sn-modified mesoporous SBA-15 material was prepared using a one-pot hydrothermal method."

[1] "The Pt-based catalysts were prepared using an incipient wetness impregnation method."

[2] "Sn-modified mesoporous SBA-15 material was prepared using a one-pot hydrothermal method."

Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It compares a one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method for incorporating tin into the SBA-15 framework versus a conventional impregnation method. The one-pot method resulted in better dispersion of tin and platinum active species.

[1] "TEM was performed using a JEOL JEM 2010 electron microscope operated at 120.0 kV."

[2] "Fig. 8 shows TEM images of the reduced catalysts. The images show that all the samples had well-ordered mesoporous structures, with hexagonally arranged pores, indicating that the samples had the two-dimensional p6mm hexagonal structure." 

[3] "The changes in the surface morphologies of the catalysts after the catalytic performance tests were investigated using TEM."

[1] "The morphologies of SBA-15 and 2Sn-SBA-15 were examined using SEM."

[2] "TEM was performed using a JEOL JEM 2010 electron microscope operated at 120.0 kV." 

[3] "Fig. 12 shows that all the samples retained a well-ordered mesoporous structure even after reaction for 6 h."

<English>
Yes, the article employs transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses TEM to examine the ordered mesoporous structure of the SBA-15 supported catalysts before and after reaction.

[1] "Fig. 9(a) shows the Pt 4f XPS profiles. The peaks at 71.3 and 74.6 eV are attributed to Pt0, and that at 78.4 eV arises from Pt4+ species."

[2] "The Sn 3d5/2 XPS profiles are shown in Fig. 9(b). Peak resolution gave three peaks at around 485.6, 486.5, and 487.2 eV, which were assigned to different Sn species."

<English>
Yes, the article uses XPS to probe oxidation state changes of Pt and Sn species during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows Pt is present as both metallic Pt0 and oxidized Pt4+ states after reaction, while Sn is mostly present as Sn2+ and Sn4+ oxide species.
