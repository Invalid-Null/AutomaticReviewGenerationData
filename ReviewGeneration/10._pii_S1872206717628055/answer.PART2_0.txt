1. 文章没有比较金属型与氧化型负载金属催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的选择性特征。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "Pt-based catalysts show good initial activities in propane dehydrogenation; this is because Pt activates CH bonds without promoting CC cleavage [12, 13]." 

[2] "The catalytic performances of these catalysts were compared with that of a catalyst prepared using a conventional impregnation method."

[3] "The results show that incorporation of Sn species produced strong interactions between Sn species and the support, resulting in large amounts of Sn in a stable oxidized form. The introduction of Sn using the one-pot method also improved the promotion efficiency of Sn compared with that of Sn in the impregnated sample."

[4] "The Pt catalysts supported on Sn-incorporated SBA-15 showed excellent catalytic activities and stabilities in propane dehydrogenation. The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 sample showed the best propene selectivity, i.e., 98.5%, with a corresponding propane conversion of about 43.8%."

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It compares the performance of Pt/Sn-SBA-15 catalysts prepared by one-pot hydrothermal synthesis versus conventional impregnation. The one-pot method gave better Sn dispersion and interactions with the support, leading to higher activity and selectivity. The Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15 catalyst showed 98.5% propene selectivity at 43.8% propane conversion.

2. 是的,文章评估了Pt-Sn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它比较了一锅法水热合成制备的Pt/Sn-SBA-15催化剂与常规浸渍法制备的催化剂的性能。一锅法给出了更好的Sn分散性和与支撑体的相互作用,导致了更高的活性和选择性。Pt/0.5Sn-SBA-15催化剂在43.8%的丙烷转化率下显示出98.5%的丙烯选择性。
