To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the quotes and answers provided in each file to the correct answers. I calculated the percentage of quotes and main ideas that matched the correct answers to quantify the consistency ratio. For Question 5, some files received partial credit if they mentioned TEM characterization but did not specify investigation of metal-support interfaces. Let me know if you have any other questions!
