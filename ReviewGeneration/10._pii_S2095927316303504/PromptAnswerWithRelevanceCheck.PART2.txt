 Unfortunately this literature review does not contain any relevant information to answer the specific questions asked. The article focuses on heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions, but does not evaluate propane dehydrogenation catalysts or provide examples investigating electronic/geometric effects, subsurface promoters, synergistic effects between metals, or different zeolite supports specifically for propane dehydrogenation.

 Unfortunately this literature review does not contain information to answer any of the specific questions asked. The review focuses on comparing heterogeneous vs. homogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, mainly for cycloalkanes and linear alkanes larger than C4. It does not evaluate propane dehydrogenation performance specifically, effects of metals, supports, or structure-function relationships for propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
