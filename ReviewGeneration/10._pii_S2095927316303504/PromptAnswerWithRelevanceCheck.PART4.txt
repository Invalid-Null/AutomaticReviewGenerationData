Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question’s section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

 Unfortunately this literature review does not contain any relevant information to answer the specific questions you have asked about propane dehydrogenation. The review focuses on general catalytic alkane dehydrogenation reactions and does not go into details about propane dehydrogenation specifically. Since there are no relevant quotes from the text, I will summarize that none of the questions can be answered based on the given literature.

 Unfortunately this literature review does not contain any relevant information to answer the specific questions you posed related to propane dehydrogenation. The article focuses on overviewing progress in heterogeneous and homogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysis in general, without any specific discussion of process intensification approaches, techno-economics, safety issues, remaining challenges, computational catalyst screening, in-situ characterization, or transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation. Since there are no relevant quotes from the literature, I will simply state "No relevant quotes" for each question below:
