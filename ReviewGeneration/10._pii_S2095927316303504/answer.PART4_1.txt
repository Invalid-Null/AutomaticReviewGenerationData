 Unfortunately this literature review does not contain any relevant information to answer the specific questions you posed related to propane dehydrogenation. The article focuses on overviewing progress in heterogeneous and homogeneous alkane dehydrogenation catalysis in general, without any specific discussion of process intensification approaches, techno-economics, safety issues, remaining challenges, computational catalyst screening, in-situ characterization, or transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation. Since there are no relevant quotes from the literature, I will simply state "No relevant quotes" for each question below:
