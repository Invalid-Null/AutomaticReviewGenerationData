I analyzed each answer file's responses for the 7 questions and compared them to the correct answers provided. I calculated a consistency percentage for each question and answer file combination based on whether the responses matched the correct answer. This percentage is expressed in the XML, with 100% meaning completely consistent and 0% meaning completely inconsistent.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
