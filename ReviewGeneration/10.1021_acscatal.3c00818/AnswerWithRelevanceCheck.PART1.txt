         [1] A series of ex/in situ characterizations further reveal the surface abundance of Ovac and coordinatively unsaturated Ti4c sites on the TiOx ultrathin nanosheet, whose concentration further boosts during the H2 reduction process, and a clear monotonous correlation between the concentration of Ovac and Ti4c sites and the catalytic dehydrogenation activity, indicating that the coordinatively unsaturated Ti sites can be identified as the more reactive centers with stronger CH bond activation ability. 

         [2] The formation of dynamic H adsorbates on tetracoordinated Ti4c sites during the PDH reaction effectively promotes CH bond activation and/or H2 desorption by altering the binding state of propane molecules during dehydrogenation and recombining with the H extracted from propane to form H2 and desorb, leading to more enhanced catalytic activity.

      Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of TiOx affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It reveals that the abundance of oxygen vacancies and tetracoordinated Ti4c sites on the TiOx nanosheet surface boosts during H2 reduction, and shows a clear correlation between the concentration of these defects and catalytic activity. It also shows that dynamic H adsorbates on Ti4c sites promote CH activation and H2 desorption by altering the binding state of propane molecules.

      答案:是的,本文研究了调节TiOx的氧化态、氧的迁移性以及酸碱性如何影响丙烷脱氢反应性能。它揭示了TiOx纳米片层表面上的氧空位和四配位Ti4c位点在H2还原过程中增多,并显示这些缺陷的浓度与催化活性之间存在明确的相关性。它还显示,Ti4c位点上的动态H吸附物可以通过改变丙烷分子的结合状态来促进CH激活和H2解吸。

         [1] On the basis of the discussion above, we herein propose the kinetic relevance and involvement of tetracoordinated Ti sites as illustrated in Figure 5a,b. The formation of the unique structure of 2D TiOx ultrathin nanosheets renders an enhancing proportion of coordinatively unsaturated Ti4c sites adjacent to Ovac on the catalyst surface, whose concentration further boosts during the H2 reduction process with the generation of a quasi-dative bonding between the Lewis basic terminal hydroxyl group (TiOH) and Lewis acidic Ti4c sites.

         [2] This surface-frustrated Lewis pair (HOTiOvacTi4c) further facilitates the heterolytic dissociation of cofeeding H2 by providing lone-pair electrons in Lewis base and empty orbitals in Lewis acid sites to bind H+ and H-, respectively, generating hydridic H adsorbates on tetracoordinated Ti4c sites, which, according to the projected density-of-state calculation, creates an energy state close to the Fermi level in the band structure as depicted in Figure 5c, altering the binding state of propane molecules during dehydrogenation, and recombines with the H extracted from propane to form H2.

      Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the TiOx nanosheet catalysts. It describes the kinetic relevance and involvement of tetracoordinated Ti4c sites adjacent to oxygen vacancies as the key active sites. The reaction steps involve heterolytic H2 dissociation on the Ti4c-Ovac frustrated Lewis pairs to form hydridic H adsorbates on Ti4c sites, which then alter propane binding and facilitate dehydrogenation, with H recombining to form H2.

      答案:是的,本文为TiOx纳米片层催化剂的丙烷脱氢反应提出了机理场景。它描述了邻近氧空位的四配位Ti4c位点的动力学相关性和作用。反应步骤包括H2在Ti4c-Ovac受阻的Lewis酸碱对上发生异裂解形成Ti4c位点上的氢化物H吸附物,进而改变丙烷的结合状态并促进脱氢,H重新结合生成H2。
