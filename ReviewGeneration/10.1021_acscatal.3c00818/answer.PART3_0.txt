[1] "The TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalyst was synthesized by the solgel method with a weight ratio of TiOx/(TiOx + Al2O3) of 1:10 as shown in Figure 1a."

[2] "Nominal molar ratios utilized were water/isopropanol/acid/CTAB/alkoxide = 20:6:0.2:0.05:1." 

[3] "The loading of TiOx was optimized to be 10 wt % by comparing the propane conversion of TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts with 5, 10, and 20 wt % of TiOx (Figure 2b)."

[1] "In situ XPS measurements were performed to acquire information about the chemical bonding and valence distribution of surface Ti and O species under a dynamic atmosphere (Figure 3c)."

[2] "The catalyst under an inert N2 atmosphere exhibited two peaks centered at about 464.5 and 458.7 eV, which can be ascribed to the characteristic Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 peaks of Ti4+."

[3] "After H2 treatment for 1 h, the Ti 2p3/2 peak became asymmetric due to the contribution of the formation of Ti3+ located at a lower binding energy (457.5 eV)."
</quotes>

<English version answer> 
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), an X-ray based technique, to probe oxidation state changes of Ti species during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it shows a reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ after H2 treatment.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文使用了一种基于X射线的技术——X射线光电子能谱法(XPS)来探究丙烷脱氢催化过程中Ti物种的氧化态变化。具体而言,它显示H2处理后Ti4+被还原为Ti3+。
