[1] "In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFTS) measurements using CO adsorption as a probe over TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts with H2 prereduction were conducted."

[2] "In situ Raman spectra for TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts under a H2-reducing atmosphere (Figure 3b) exhibited two sharp bands at 341 and 412 cm−1 and a relatively broadband at 707 cm−1." 

[3] "In situ XPS measurements were further performed to acquire information about the chemical bonding and valence distribution of surface Ti and O species under a dynamic atmosphere (Figure 3c)."

[4] "The resulting presence and absence of HD signal without or with an interval of 30 min of Ar purging when exchanging H2 by D2 indicate the existence of metastable H species adsorbed on the defective TiOx nanosheet surface with abundant Ovac and Ticus sites, which readily desorb upon the removal of H2 feeding at a high temperature (600 °C), while the appearance of the HDO signal, which originated from the combination of the hydroxyl group (TiOH) and D atom, was unaffected by the purging step."

[1] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis (Figure 1e) can capture nanosheets standing on their edges with the thickness estimated to be around 12 nm (only nanosheets parallel or at a small angle to the electron beam can be observed, while those perpendicular to the electron beam are difficult to observe due to the ultrathin character)."

[2] "Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis (Figure 1c,d) confirmed that the majority of synthesized nanosheets were around 1.5 nm thick, which agrees well with the estimation from HR-TEM images, with the coexistent small portion of thicker nanosheets."

[3] "The thicker nanosheets were deliberately intercepted (Figure 1d), and the thickness was around 3.5 nm, which may result from the stacking of nanosheets."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article employs HR-TEM and AFM to characterize the metal-support interface and thickness of the TiOx nanosheets. These techniques revealed that the nanosheets were approximately 1.5-3.5 nm thick, corresponding to around 2 atomic layers of TiOx.  
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文采用HR-TEM和AFM表征TiOx纳米片的金属-支撑体界面和厚度。这些技术揭示纳米片的厚度约为1.5-3.5 nm,对应TiOx的约2个原子层。

[1] "In situ XPS measurements were further performed to acquire information about the chemical bonding and valence distribution of surface Ti and O species under a dynamic atmosphere (Figure 3c)." 

[2] "The fraction of Ti3+/ (Ti3++ Ti4+) obtained by peak deconvolution confirmed that TiO2 was partially reduced to TiOx species and more O were released from the lattice to generate more Ovac under a H2 atmosphere, consistent with the fitting analysis of O 1s spectra shown in Figure S8 and Table 1 where the growing fraction of Ovac (14.1→22.2%) upon reduction was observed."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses in-situ XPS to probe oxidation state changes of Ti during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. XPS revealed an increase in reduced Ti3+ species and oxygen vacancies upon H2 reduction of the TiOx catalyst.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文使用原位XPS技术探究了Ti在丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。XPS结果显示,H2使TiOx催化剂还原后,Ti3+量和氧空位增加。
