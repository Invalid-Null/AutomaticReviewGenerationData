[1] A series of ex/in situ characterizations further reveal the surface abundance of Ovac and coordinatively unsaturated Ti4c sites on the TiOx ultrathin nanosheet, whose concentration further boosts during the H2 reduction process, and a clear monotonous correlation between the concentration of Ovac and Ti4c sites and the catalytic dehydrogenation activity, indicating that the coordinatively unsaturated Ti sites can be identified as the more reactive centers with stronger CH bond activation ability.

[2] The formation of dynamic H adsorbates on tetracoordinated Ti4c sites during the PDH reaction effectively promotes CH bond activation and/or H2 desorption by altering the binding state of propane molecules during dehydrogenation and recombining with the H extracted from propane to form H2 and desorb, leading to more enhanced catalytic activity.

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of TiOx affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It reveals that the abundance of oxygen vacancies and tetracoordinated Ti4c sites on the TiOx nanosheet surface boosts during H2 reduction, and shows a clear correlation between the concentration of these defects and catalytic activity. It also shows that dynamic H adsorbates on Ti4c sites promote CH activation and H2 desorption by altering the binding state of propane molecules.

[1] On the basis of the discussion above, we herein propose the kinetic relevance and involvement of tetracoordinated Ti sites as illustrated in Figure 5a,b. The formation of the unique structure of 2D TiOx ultrathin nanosheets renders an enhancing proportion of coordinatively unsaturated Ti4c sites adjacent to Ovac on the catalyst surface, whose concentration further boosts during the H2 reduction process with the generation of a quasi-dative bonding between the Lewis basic terminal hydroxyl group (TiOH) and Lewis acidic Ti4c sites. 

[2] This surface-frustrated Lewis pair (HOTiOvacTi4c) further facilitates the heterolytic dissociation of cofeeding H2 by providing lone-pair electrons in Lewis base and empty orbitals in Lewis acid sites to bind H+ and H-, respectively, generating hydridic H adsorbates on tetracoordinated Ti4c sites, which, according to the projected density-of-state calculation, creates an energy state close to the Fermi level in the band structure as depicted in Figure 5c, altering the binding state of propane molecules during dehydrogenation, and recombines with the H extracted from propane to form H2. The involvement of tetracoordinated Ti as active sites during the PDH reaction derived from the unique structure of 2D TiOx ultrathin nanosheets effectively promotes CH bond activation and/or H2 desorption, leading to more enhanced catalytic activity.

Answer: Yes, the article proposes mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over the TiOx nanosheet catalysts. It describes the kinetic relevance and involvement of tetracoordinated Ti4c sites adjacent to oxygen vacancies. It proposes that surface Lewis acid-base pairs dissociate co-fed H2, generating H adsorbates on Ti4c sites which alter the binding state of propane and promote CH activation and H2 desorption.
