[1] "Surface-sensitive characterization technologies were performed to detect the electronic states and coordination environments of surface defect sites."

[2] "In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFTS) measurements using CO adsorption as a probe over TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts with H2 prereduction were conducted." 

[3] "In situ XPS measurements were further performed to acquire information about the chemical bonding and valence distribution of surface Ti and O species under a dynamic atmosphere (Figure 3c)."

[4] "In situ Raman spectra for TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts under a H2-reducing atmosphere (Figure 3b) exhibited two sharp bands at 341 and 412 cm-1 and a relatively broadband at 707 cm-1."

[1] "The morphology verified by the combined HR-TEM, EDS mapping, and AFM techniques."

[2] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis (Figure 1e) can capture nanosheets standing on their edges with the thickness estimated to be around 12 nm (only nanosheets parallel or at a small angle to the electron beam can be observed, while those perpendicular to the electron beam are difficult to observe due to the ultrathin character)." 

[3] "Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis (Figure 1c,d) confirmed that the majority of synthesized nanosheets were around 1.5 nm thick."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article employs advanced microscopy techniques including HR-TEM, EDS mapping, and AFM to characterize the metal-support interface in the TiOx/Al2O3 propane dehydrogenation catalyst. These techniques revealed the ultrathin, 2-atomic layer thick nanosheet morphology of the TiO phase.

[1] "In situ XPS measurements were further performed to acquire information about the chemical bonding and valence distribution of surface Ti and O species under a dynamic atmosphere (Figure 3c)."

[2] "The fraction of Ti3+/ (Ti3++ Ti4+) obtained by peak deconvolution confirmed that TiO2 was partially reduced to TiOx species and more O were released from the lattice to generate more Ovac under a H2 atmosphere, consistent with the fitting analysis of O 1s spectra shown in Figure S8 and Table 1 where the growing fraction of Ovac (14.1→22.2%) upon reduction was observed."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), an X-ray based technique, to probe oxidation state changes of Ti during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. In-situ XPS revealed an increase in reduced Ti3+ species and oxygen vacancies under reducing conditions relevant to the reaction.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文采用基于X射线的X射线光电子能谱技术来探测丙烷脱氢反应过程中Ti的氧化态变化。原位XPS结果显示,在与反应相关的还原条件下,Ti3+还原态和氧空隙增加。
