         [1] "The TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalyst was synthesized by the solgel method with a weight ratio of TiOx/(TiOx + Al2O3) of 1:10 as shown in Figure 1a." 
         [2] "Nominal molar ratios utilized were water/isopropanol/acid/CTAB/alkoxide = 20:6:0.2:0.05:1."
         [3] "The loading of TiOx was optimized to be 10 wt % by comparing the propane conversion of TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts with 5, 10, and 20 wt % of TiOx (Figure 2b)."

         [1] "Surface-sensitive characterization technologies were performed to detect the electronic states and coordination environments of surface defect sites."
         [2] "In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFTS) measurements using CO adsorption as a probe over TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts with H2 prereduction were conducted."
         [3] "In situ Raman spectra for TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts under a H2-reducing atmosphere (Figure 3b) exhibited two sharp bands at 341 and 412 cm−1 and a relatively broadband at 707 cm−1." 
         [4] "In situ XPS measurements were further performed to acquire information about the chemical bonding and valence distribution of surface Ti and O species under a dynamic atmosphere (Figure 3c)."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques including DRIFTS, Raman spectroscopy, and XPS to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. These provide insights into the coordination environments, electronic states, and valence distributions of surface active sites under reaction conditions.

         [1] "High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis (Figure 1e) can capture nanosheets standing on their edges with the thickness estimated to be around 12 nm (only nanosheets parallel or at a small angle to the electron beam can be observed, while those perpendicular to the electron beam are difficult to observe due to the ultrathin character)." 
         [2] "Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis (Figure 1c,d) confirmed that the majority of synthesized nanosheets were around 1.5 nm thick, which agrees well with the estimation from HR-TEM images, with the coexistent small portion of thicker nanosheets." 
         [3] "The thicker nanosheets were deliberately intercepted (Figure 1d), and the thickness was around 3.5 nm, which may result from the stacking of nanosheets."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
         Answer: Yes, the article employs HR-TEM and AFM to characterize the metal-support interface and thickness of the TiOx nanosheets. These techniques revealed that the nanosheets were approximately 1.5-3.5 nm thick, corresponding to around 2 atomic layers of TiOx.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         答:是的,该文采用HR-TEM和AFM表征TiOx纳米片的金属-支撑体界面和厚度。这些技术揭示纳米片的厚度约为1.5-3.5 nm,对应TiOx的约2个原子层。

         [1] "In situ XPS measurements were further performed to acquire information about the chemical bonding and valence distribution of surface Ti and O species under a dynamic atmosphere (Figure 3c)."
         [2] "The fraction of Ti3+/ (Ti3++ Ti4+) obtained by peak deconvolution confirmed that TiO2 was partially reduced to TiOx species and more O were released from the lattice to generate more Ovac under a H2 atmosphere, consistent with the fitting analysis of O 1s spectra shown in Figure S8 and Table 1 where the growing fraction of Ovac (14.1→22.2%) upon reduction was observed."

      <English>
         Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), an X-ray based technique, to probe oxidation state changes of Ti species during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it shows a reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ after H2 treatment.
