I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

Benzene Alkylation with Propane over Pt-Modified MFI Zeolites
Abstract
Benzene alkylation with propane has been studied on acidic H-MFI zeolites with SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of 51, 104, and 325, mixed (H-MFI+Pt/CeO2) catalytic systems, and Pt/H-MFI bifunctional catalysts with Pt content of 0.02 and 0.3%. In some of the experiments, Zr2Fe intermetallic compound was added to the catalytic system to ensure H2 removal from the reaction zone. The reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure, in the temperature range of 573773 K, C3H8/C6H6=1, and WHSV=0.27 h1. The conversion of propane and selectivity to propylbenzenes was found to increase in the following order of catalytic systems: H-MFI<(H-MFI+Pt/CeO2)<Pt/H-MFI<(Pt/H-MFI+Zr2Fe). The increase of the number of strong Brnsted sites in zeolite led, on one hand, to the increase of propane conversion, but on the other hand, to the decrease of the selectivity to target products, which was due to the cracking of propane and propylbenzenes dealkylation and dismutation. Incorporation of Pt into the catalytic system enhanced propane dehydrogenation at the expense of its cracking and resulted in significant improvement of propane conversion and selectivity to propylbenzenes. Addition of an H2 scavenger allowed a shift of the thermodynamic equilibria and an increase in propane and benzene conversion. The best result was obtained on the (Pt/H-MFI+Zr2Fe) catalytic system with an SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 325 and a Pt content of 0.22%, on which the yield of propylbenzenes reached 96% with respect to equilibrium and selectivity to propylbenzenes was about 60%. The mechanisms of benzene alkylation with propane operating on various catalysts are discussed.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
