[1] "By combining density functional theory computations, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, in situ Raman characterization, and microkinetic modeling, we propose that dimerized di-coordinated boron sites (>BB<)dynamically formed in liquid boron oxideare the active species for O2 activation under reaction conditions."

[2] "The structure of the liquid B2O3 was also probed using the in situ Raman at 850 K under N2 conditions specifically for this work..."  

[3] "Combining the VDOS and in situ Raman spectra, we can conclude that peaks at 807 and 462 cm−1 (Figure 5A) can be attributed to the contribution of boroxol rings and di-coordinate BO1• sites, respectively."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ Raman characterization to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts based on liquid boron oxide. Specifically, it combines in-situ Raman spectra at 850K with computed vibrational density of states to identify signature peaks corresponding to proposed active sites like boroxol rings and di-coordinated boron. This provides support for the presence of these dynamically formed species under reaction conditions.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

4.是的,本文利用了原位拉曼表征来研究基于液态硼氧化物的工作丙烷脱氢催化剂。具体来说,它结合了850K下的原位拉曼光谱与计算的振动密度态,以确定对应硼氧烷环和二配位硼等提议的活性位点的特征峰。这支持了这些动态形成的物种在反应条件下的存在。
