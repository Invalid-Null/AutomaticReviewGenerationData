 Unfortunately the given literature does not provide any relevant information to answer the questions asked. The paper focuses on evaluating PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalysts prepared at different pH values for propane dehydrogenation, and does not discuss other types of metal oxide or supported metal catalysts. The only catalysts studied are PtIn/Mg(Al)O prepared by co-precipitation at pH 6-12. Since the questions ask about properties and mechanistic insights for other catalysts not covered in the literature, there are no relevant quotes or information that can be extracted to answer them.

<English version answer>

1. The literature does not evaluate any promising metal oxide catalysts like Cr2O3, Pt-Sn, Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation, so no examples, data or insights about their performance are provided.

2. The literature does not investigate tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides, so no examples or relationships for propane dehydrogenation are revealed. 

3. The literature does not propose any mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts, so no reaction steps, intermediates or active sites are described.

4. The literature does not explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, so no examples or insights into activity and selectivity modulation are provided.

5. The literature does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir for propane dehydrogenation, so no data, characterizations or insights about their performance are provided.

6. The literature does not investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect performance of supported metal catalysts, so no examples or structure-function relationships are revealed. 

7. The literature does not propose any mechanistic reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over supported metal catalysts, so no steps, intermediates or active sites are described.

<Chinese version answer>

1. 文献没有评估任何有前途的金属氧化物催化剂,如Cr2O3、Pt-Sn、Ga2O3用于丙烷脱氢,所以没有提供相关的实例、数据或见解。

2. 文献没有研究如何调节金属氧化物的氧化态、氧的迁移性和酸碱性质,所以没有揭示丙烷脱氢的相关例子或关系。

3. 文献没有提出任何金属氧化物催化剂丙烷脱氢的机理场景,所以没有描述反应步骤、中间体或活性位点。

4. 文献没有探讨金属氧化物催化剂用于丙烷脱氢中金属与载体的界面效应,所以没有提供相关的例子或对活性和选择性调控的见解。

5. 文献没有评估任何负载单金属催化剂,如Pt、Pd或Ir用于丙烷脱氢,所以没有提供相关的数据、表征或见解。

6. 文献没有研究金属粒径、形状和载体相互作用等属性如何影响负载金属催化剂的性能,所以没有揭示相关的例子或结构-功能关系。

7. 文献没有提出任何负载金属催化剂丙烷脱氢的机理反应途径,所以没有描述步骤、中间体或活性位点。
