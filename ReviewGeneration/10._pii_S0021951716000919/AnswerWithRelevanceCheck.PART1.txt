 Unfortunately, based on my review, the provided answers do not contain relevant information to address the questions asked. The answers indicate that the referenced article focuses solely on evaluating PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalysts prepared at different pH values for propane dehydrogenation. It does not discuss other types of metal oxide or supported metal catalysts. Since the questions inquire about properties and mechanistic insights for catalysts not covered in the literature, there are no applicable quotes or details that can be extracted.

Therefore, my assessment is:

※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※
