<Answer>

 Unfortunately, this literature does not provide sufficient information to answer any of the specific questions asked. The article focuses on the effect of dechlorination treatment time on the properties and catalytic performance of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It does not provide details about the importance and applications of propylene, mechanisms of catalyst activity, major catalyst classes explored, thermodynamic or kinetic factors, DFT calculations, microkinetic modeling, or structure-activity relationships.

 Unfortunately, this literature does not provide relevant information to answer any of the specific questions asked. The article focuses on the optimization of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation through different dechlorination treatments. It does not provide background on the value and applications of propylene, discuss propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and kinetics in detail, present computational studies, or identify catalyst descriptors. 

Since there are no relevant quotes from the literature for these questions, I will simply state "No relevant quotes" for each one.

 Unfortunately, this literature does not provide sufficient information to adequately answer the questions asked. The article is focused on the effects of different dechlorination times on the catalytic performance of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. While it provides some background on the importance of propylene production and the use of catalysts to facilitate propane dehydrogenation reactions, it does not go into details about reaction mechanisms, kinetics, thermodynamics, computational modeling, or structure-activity relationships. The questions seem more tailored to a broad review of propane dehydrogenation catalysts and mechanisms rather than this specific study on dechlorination effects for one catalyst system. As such, there is not enough relevant information in the given literature to address most of the questions posed.
