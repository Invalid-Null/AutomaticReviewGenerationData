 Unfortunately, this literature does not provide sufficient information to adequately answer the questions asked. The article is focused on the effects of different dechlorination times on the catalytic performance of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. While it provides some background on the importance of propylene production and the use of catalysts to facilitate propane dehydrogenation reactions, it does not go into details about reaction mechanisms, kinetics, thermodynamics, computational modeling, or structure-activity relationships. The questions seem more tailored to a broad review of propane dehydrogenation catalysts and mechanisms rather than this specific study on dechlorination effects for one catalyst system. As such, there is not enough relevant information in the given literature to address most of the questions posed.

1. No, the article does not provide background details on the importance or applications of propylene. It only states there is an increasing demand for propylene without further context.

2. No, the article does not explain general propane dehydrogenation mechanisms or how catalysts facilitate reactions. It focuses specifically on PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalysts. 

3. No, the article does not introduce major catalyst classes for propane dehydrogenation beyond PtSnNa/ZSM-5.

4. No, the article does not discuss thermodynamic constraints or kinetic factors for propane dehydrogenation. 

5. No, the article does not describe any DFT calculations for propane dehydrogenation mechanisms.

6. No, the article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation kinetics.  

7. No, the article does not identify catalyst descriptors or structure-activity relationships beyond the specific PtSnNa/ZSM-5 system studied.
