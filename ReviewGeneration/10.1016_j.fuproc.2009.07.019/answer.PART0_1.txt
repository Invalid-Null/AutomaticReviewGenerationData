 Unfortunately, this literature does not provide relevant information to answer any of the specific questions asked. The article focuses on the optimization of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation through different dechlorination treatments. It does not provide background on the value and applications of propylene, discuss propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and kinetics in detail, present computational studies, or identify catalyst descriptors. 

Since there are no relevant quotes from the literature for these questions, I will simply state "No relevant quotes" for each one.
