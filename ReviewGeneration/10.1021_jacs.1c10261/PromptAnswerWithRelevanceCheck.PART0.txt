<quotes>

[1] "Thermal dehydrogenation of propane (PDH), derived from shale gas, is an attractive source of propene for manufacturing polypropene, propene oxide, acrylic acid, and acrylonitrile."

[2] "Pt is the metal of choice as an industrial PDH catalyst because it exhibits high activity for CH bond activation and relatively low activity for the undesired CC bond cleavage."

<quotes>

[1] "Incorporation of other elements (e.g., Cu, Zn, Fe, Ga, In, Sn, Mn, Co, and La) reduces the size of Pt ensembles on the bimetallic Pt cluster surfaces." 

[2] "Cluster size affects all aspects of the performance of Pt for PDH. As Pt dispersion increases from 2 nm clusters to single atoms, the turnover frequency (TOF) for propane consumption increases, as does the propene selectivity, and catalyst stability parallels propene selectivity."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. The article introduces supported metals, alloys, and bimetallic clusters as catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation. It provides examples of adding Cu, Zn, Fe, Ga, In, Sn, Mn, Co, and La to Pt clusters, which reduces ensemble size and increases propene selectivity and stability. It also discusses how decreasing Pt cluster size from 2 nm to single atoms increases turnover frequency and propene selectivity.
