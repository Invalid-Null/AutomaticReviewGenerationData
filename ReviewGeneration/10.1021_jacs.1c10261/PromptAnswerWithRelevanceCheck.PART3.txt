1. "Zeolite H-Beta (provided by BASF) with a Si/Al ratio of 13 (determined by ICP analysis) was suspended in 13 M nitric acid at 373 K by stirring for 20 h to obtain DeAlBEA."

2. "Afterward, the DeAlBEA was impregnated with an aqueous metal nitrate solution. Specifically, the molar concentrations of Zn2+ and Pt2+ solutions were about 0.044, 0.087, and 0.13 mol/L for M/Al ratios (mols of metal introduced per mol of Al in zeolite H-Beta prior to dealumination) of 0.12, 0.24, and 0.36, respectively."

3. "Pt was added to Zn-DeAlBEA as described in Experimental Methods."

4. "HAADF-STEM images of as-prepared 0.04Pt-0.36Zn-DeAlBEA at various resolutions are presented in Figure 3A-F. The white spots evident in panels A and B of Figure 3, taken with resolutions of 5 and 2 nm, respectively, might at first be taken as evidence of nanoparticles. However, when the resolution is increased to 1 nm (Figure 3C), it is clear that these spots comprise isolated Pt atoms."  

5. "Figure 3C-F shows that the Pt atoms are spaced 3.6-11 Å apart. We emphasize that these distances are markedly longer than bonding distances and specifically longer than those in PtZn alloy nanoparticles, for which distances of 2.6-92.86 Å have been reported, consistent with the value of 2.84 Å for bulk crystalline PtZn alloy."

22. Yes, the article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single sites in zeolitic supports. Specifically, it discusses dealuminating zeolite H-Beta with nitric acid to create silanol nests, then impregnating the dealuminated zeolite (DeAlBEA) with aqueous solutions of Zn(NO3)2 and (NH3)4Pt(NO3)2 to introduce isolated Zn and Pt sites into the silanol nests (Quotes 1-3). 

23. Yes, the article evaluates encapsulating Pt atoms within Zn-functionalized zeolite supports to enhance catalyst stability for propane dehydrogenation.

No relevant quotes.

[1] Atomically dispersed noble metal catalysts have drawn wide attention as candidates to replace supported metal clusters and metal nanoparticles. Atomic dispersion can offer unique chemical properties as well as maximum utilization of the expensive metals.

[2] We now report attainment of these goals.

[3] However, the stabilization of isolated Pt atoms in small nests of nonprecious metal atoms remains challenging.

[4] HAADF-STEM images of as-prepared 0.04Pt-0.36Zn-DeAlBEA at various resolutions are presented in Figure 3AF. The white spots evident in panels A and B of Figure 3, taken with resolutions of 5 and 2 nm, respectively, might at first be taken as evidence of nanoparticles. However, when the resolution is increased to 1 nm (Figure 3C), it is clear that these spots comprise isolated Pt atoms. 

[5] In summary, the IR, UVvis, and NMR spectra demonstrate that Zn Lewis acid sites introduced into the silanol nests of DeAlBEA are stabilized by MOSi bonds. The STEM images demonstrate the presence of SiOZnOH nests, and the UVvis spectra, STEM images, and XAS data suggest that these groups interact weakly with each other. 

[6] Continuous extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were measured at 298 K from 200 eV below the Pt LIII-edge (11564 eV) to k = 15.3 Å1 (k is the wavenumber), and at 298 K from 200 eV below the Zn K-edge (9659 eV) to k = 15.3 Å1 in a period of 4 min, with three scans collected and averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio under all conditions.

1. The article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single Pt sites in zeolitic DeAlBEA supports. Specifically, it removes Al atoms to create silanol nests, introduces Zn atoms to form SiOZnOH groups, and then grafts Pt atoms into these nests to create isolated Pt sites stabilized by multiple Zn atoms.

2. Yes, the article evaluates encapsulating Pt atoms within Zn-functionalized zeolite supports to enhance stability for propane dehydrogenation. Data shows the resulting catalyst has high activity, 99% selectivity, and excellent stability over 12+ hours time-on-stream.

3. Yes, the article investigates preparing the catalysts with the aim of optimizing Pt dispersion. Techniques include controlling the Si/Al ratio upon dealumination to optimize nest site density, and controlling the Zn/Al ratio for embedding isolated Pt atoms within multi-Zn nests. STEM imaging verified isolated Pt atoms were achieved.

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ EXAFS to study the catalysts during pretreatment and during propane dehydrogenation. This revealed changes in Pt and Zn oxidation states, local coordination environments, and metal-support interactions under working conditions.

5. Yes, the article uses HAADF-STEM imaging with resolutions down to 1 nm to directly characterize the Pt-support interfaces and metal dispersion. Images definitively revealed isolated Pt atoms stabilized on the support, rather than clusters or nanoparticles.

6. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on a fixed bed reactor setup.
