[1] Atomically dispersed noble metal catalysts have drawn wide attention as candidates to replace supported metal clusters and metal nanoparticles. Atomic dispersion can offer unique chemical properties as well as maximum utilization of the expensive metals.

[2] We now report attainment of these goals.

[3] However, the stabilization of isolated Pt atoms in small nests of nonprecious metal atoms remains challenging.

[4] HAADF-STEM images of as-prepared 0.04Pt-0.36Zn-DeAlBEA at various resolutions are presented in Figure 3AF. The white spots evident in panels A and B of Figure 3, taken with resolutions of 5 and 2 nm, respectively, might at first be taken as evidence of nanoparticles. However, when the resolution is increased to 1 nm (Figure 3C), it is clear that these spots comprise isolated Pt atoms. 

[5] In summary, the IR, UVvis, and NMR spectra demonstrate that Zn Lewis acid sites introduced into the silanol nests of DeAlBEA are stabilized by MOSi bonds. The STEM images demonstrate the presence of SiOZnOH nests, and the UVvis spectra, STEM images, and XAS data suggest that these groups interact weakly with each other. 

[6] Continuous extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were measured at 298 K from 200 eV below the Pt LIII-edge (11564 eV) to k = 15.3 Å1 (k is the wavenumber), and at 298 K from 200 eV below the Zn K-edge (9659 eV) to k = 15.3 Å1 in a period of 4 min, with three scans collected and averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio under all conditions.

1. The article describes techniques for synthesizing isolated single Pt sites in zeolitic DeAlBEA supports. Specifically, it removes Al atoms to create silanol nests, introduces Zn atoms to form SiOZnOH groups, and then grafts Pt atoms into these nests to create isolated Pt sites stabilized by multiple Zn atoms.

2. Yes, the article evaluates encapsulating Pt atoms within Zn-functionalized zeolite supports to enhance stability for propane dehydrogenation. Data shows the resulting catalyst has high activity, 99% selectivity, and excellent stability over 12+ hours time-on-stream. The Zn anchoring is proposed to isolate the Pt atoms and strengthen Pt-Zn vs Pt-Pt bonding.

3. Yes, the article investigates preparing the catalysts with the aim of optimizing Pt dispersion. Techniques include controlling the Si/Al ratio upon dealumination to optimize nest site density, and controlling the Zn/Al ratio for embedding isolated Pt atoms within multi-Zn nests. STEM imaging verified isolated Pt atoms were achieved.

4. Yes, the article utilizes in-situ EXAFS to study the catalysts during pretreatment and during propane dehydrogenation. This revealed changes in Pt and Zn oxidation states, local coordination environments, and metal-support interactions under working conditions.

5. Yes, the article uses HAADF-STEM imaging with resolutions down to 1 nm to directly characterize the Pt-support interfaces and metal dispersion. Images definitively revealed isolated Pt atoms stabilized on the support, rather than clusters or nanoparticles.

6. No, the article does not evaluate different reactor types for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on a fixed bed reactor setup.

1.这篇文章描述了在沸石支撑上合成隔离的单点位Pt的技术。具体来说,它去除Al原子以创建硅醇巢,引入Zn原子以形成SiOZnOH基团,然后将Pt原子嫁接到这些巢穴中以创建被多个Zn原子稳定的隔离Pt位点。

2.是的,文章评估了将Pt原子封装在锌功能化沸石支撑物内,以提高丙烷脱氢稳定性。数据显示所得催化剂具有高活性、99%选择性和超过12小时启动时间的优异稳定性。Zn锚定被提出可以隔离Pt原子并加强Pt-Zn相对于Pt-Pt的键合。

3.是的,文章研究了制备催化剂的方法,目的是优化Pt的分散。技术包括控制脱铝过程中的Si/Al比以优化巢位密度,以及控制Zn/Al比以将隔离的Pt原子嵌入多Zn巢穴中。 STEM成像验证了所得Pt原子是隔离的。

4.是的,文章利用原位EXAFS技术研究了催化剂在预处理和丙烷脱氢过程中的行为。这揭示了Pt和Zn在工作条件下的氧化态、局部配位环境以及金属-支撑物相互作用的变化。

5.是的,文章使用最高达1 nm分辨率的HAADF-STEM成像直接表征了Pt-支撑物界面和金属分散。图像确定地显示了被支撑物稳定的隔离Pt原子,而不是簇或纳米粒子。

6.不,文章没有评估不同的反应器类型进行丙烷脱氢。它聚焦在固定床反应器设置上。
