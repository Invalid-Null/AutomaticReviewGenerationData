[1] "Incorporation of other elements (e.g., Cu, (24) Zn, (8,10,14) Fe, (25) Ga, (26) In, (27) Sn, (1,11,20) Mn, (28) Co, (29) and La (4)) reduces the size of Pt ensembles on the bimetallic Pt cluster surfaces."

[2] "An alternative approach to achieving high activity, selectivity, and stability is to produce isolated Pt atoms that are stabilized in small nests of nonprecious metal atoms, such as Zn." 

[3] "We now report attainment of these goals."

[4] "Atomically dispersed noble metal catalysts have drawn wide attention as candidates to replace supported metal clusters and metal nanoparticles."

[5] "Atomic dispersion can offer unique chemical properties as well as maximum utilization of the expensive metals." 

[6] "The catalyst is stable in long-term operation and exhibits high activity and high selectivity to propene."
