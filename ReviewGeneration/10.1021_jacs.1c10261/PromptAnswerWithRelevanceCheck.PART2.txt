<English version answer>

1. The article does not compare the selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts. It focuses solely on investigating atomically dispersed Pt catalysts supported on dealuminated zeolite Beta for propane dehydrogenation.

</English version answer>  

<Chinese version answer>

1. 这篇文章没有比较金属和氧化物支撑的金属催化剂的选择性配置文件。它仅专注于研究原子分散的Pt催化剂(负载在脱铝Beta分子筛上)用于丙烷脱氢反应。

</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>

[1] "Although several attempts to do so have been reported, (8,10,3133) it remains a challenge to isolate the Pt atoms entirely within nests and to achieve performance characterized by high mass-specific activity, propene selectivity, and strong resistance to sintering and deactivation during PDH."

[2] "When the Pt:Al ratio was increased from 0.04 to 0.06 and 0.10 (at a constant Zn:Al ratio of 0.36), the mass of catalyst used for each test was decreased correspondingly to keep the space velocity (now defined as the molar flow rate of propane per Pt atom) unchanged. Virtually the same activity, selectivity, and stability were observed for reactions carried out for Pt:Al ratios of 0.04 and 0.06." 

[3] "For 0.1Pt-0.36Zn-DeAlBEA, for which Zn:Pt = 3.6, the activity and selectivity were similar to that observed for higher Zn:Pt ratios, but the catalyst was less stable (the first-order deactivation rate constant kdeac increased from 0.004 to 0.014 h1, Figure S31B in the Supporting Information), indicating that the Zn:Pt ratio should be kept at values >4 in order to maintain catalyst stability."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Zn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It reports that isolating Pt atoms entirely within Zn nests in dealuminated zeolite Beta led to high activity, propene selectivity and stability for propane dehydrogenation. Increasing the Pt:Zn ratio from 4 to 3.6 resulted in similar activity but lower stability, indicating a Zn:Pt ratio >4 is optimal.  

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

2. 是的,这篇文章评估了Pt-Zn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它报道说,将Pt原子完全隔离在脱铝Beta分子筛中的Zn巢穴中,可以使丙烷脱氢反应达到高活性、丙烯选择性和稳定性。 当Pt:Zn比从4增加到3.6时,活性相似但稳定性降低,这表明Pt:Zn比>4是最佳的。

[2] "The catalyst is stable in long-term operation and exhibits high activity and high selectivity to propene."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

[1] "Incorporation of other elements (e.g., Cu, Zn, Fe, Ga, In, Sn, Mn, Co, and La) reduces the size of Pt ensembles on the bimetallic Pt cluster surfaces." 
[2] "Both the reduction in Pt cluster size and the addition of a second metal reduce the activation barrier for propene desorption relative to that for further dehydrogenation, which is undesired because it leads ultimately to coke formation and catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Table S4 in the Supporting Information provides a comparison of values of kf determined for 0.04Pt-0.36Zn-DeAlBEA with those characterizing PtZn catalysts reported in the literature, all tested at 823 K."
</quotes>

<English version answer>  
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates PtZn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing PtZn alloy clusters exhibit higher propene selectivity and lower coke formation compared to monometallic Pt clusters, due to the addition of Zn reducing the ensemble size of Pt and lowering the activation barrier for propene desorption. The article also compares the rate coefficient of 0.04Pt-0.36Zn-DeAlBEA to other PtZn catalysts, showing it has much higher intrinsic activity.

<Chinese version answer>
回答:是的,该文章评估了PtZn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它提供了数据,显示PtZn合金簇相比单金属Pt簇体系具有更高的丙烯选择性和更低的焦炭生成,这是由于添加Zn减小了Pt的集聚体大小,并降低了丙烯解吸的活化能垒。该文章还将0.04Pt-0.36Zn-DeAlBEA的速率系数与其他PtZn催化剂进行了比较,结果显示它具有更高的固有活性。
