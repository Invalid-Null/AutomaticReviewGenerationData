         The article does not compare the selectivity profiles of metallic versus oxidized supported metal catalysts. It focuses solely on investigating atomically dispersed Pt catalysts supported on dealuminated zeolite Beta for propane dehydrogenation.

         [1] "Although several attempts to do so have been reported, (8,10,3133) it remains a challenge to isolate the Pt atoms entirely within nests and to achieve performance characterized by high mass-specific activity, propene selectivity, and strong resistance to sintering and deactivation during PDH." 
         [2] "When the Pt:Al ratio was increased from 0.04 to 0.06 and 0.10 (at a constant Zn:Al ratio of 0.36), the mass of catalyst used for each test was decreased correspondingly to keep the space velocity (now defined as the molar flow rate of propane per Pt atom) unchanged. Virtually the same activity, selectivity, and stability were observed for reactions carried out for Pt:Al ratios of 0.04 and 0.06."  
         [3] "For 0.1Pt-0.36Zn-DeAlBEA, for which Zn:Pt = 3.6, the activity and selectivity were similar to that observed for higher Zn:Pt ratios, but the catalyst was less stable (the first-order deactivation rate constant kdeac increased from 0.004 to 0.014 h1, Figure S31B in the Supporting Information), indicating that the Zn:Pt ratio should be kept at values >4 in order to maintain catalyst stability."

         Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Zn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It reports that isolating Pt atoms entirely within Zn nests in dealuminated zeolite Beta led to high activity, propene selectivity and stability for propane dehydrogenation. Increasing the Pt:Zn ratio from 4 to 3.6 resulted in similar activity but lower stability, indicating a Zn:Pt ratio >4 is optimal.

         是的,这篇文章评估了Pt-Zn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它报道说,将Pt原子完全隔离在脱铝Beta分子筛中的Zn巢穴中,可以使丙烷脱氢反应达到高活性、丙烯选择性和稳定性。当Pt:Zn比从4增加到3.6时,活性相似但稳定性降低,这表明Pt:Zn比>4是最佳的。

         [1] "We now report a novel strategy for the design, synthesis, and characterization of a zeolite-supported propane dehydrogenation catalyst that incorporates predominantly isolated Pt atoms stably bonded within nests of Zn atoms located within the nanoscale pores of dealuminated zeolite Beta."
         [2] "The catalyst is stable in long-term operation and exhibits high activity and high selectivity to propene."
