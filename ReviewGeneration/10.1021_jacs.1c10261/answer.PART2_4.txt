[1] "Incorporation of other elements (e.g., Cu, Zn, Fe, Ga, In, Sn, Mn, Co, and La) reduces the size of Pt ensembles on the bimetallic Pt cluster surfaces." 
[2] "Both the reduction in Pt cluster size and the addition of a second metal reduce the activation barrier for propene desorption relative to that for further dehydrogenation, which is undesired because it leads ultimately to coke formation and catalyst deactivation."
[3] "Table S4 in the Supporting Information provides a comparison of values of kf determined for 0.04Pt-0.36Zn-DeAlBEA with those characterizing PtZn catalysts reported in the literature, all tested at 823 K."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates PtZn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing PtZn alloy clusters exhibit higher propene selectivity and lower coke formation compared to monometallic Pt clusters, due to the addition of Zn reducing the ensemble size of Pt and lowering the activation barrier for propene desorption. The article also compares the rate coefficient of 0.04Pt-0.36Zn-DeAlBEA to other PtZn catalysts, showing it has much higher intrinsic activity.

回答:是的,该文章评估了PtZn合金催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它提供了数据,显示PtZn合金簇相比单金属Pt簇体系具有更高的丙烯选择性和更低的焦炭生成,这是由于添加Zn减小了Pt的集聚体大小,并降低了丙烯解吸的活化能垒。该文章还将0.04Pt-0.36Zn-DeAlBEA的速率系数与其他PtZn催化剂进行了比较,结果显示它具有更高的固有活性。

<quotes>
[1] "Pt was added to Zn-DeAlBEA as described in Experimental Methods. HAADF-STEM images of as-prepared 0.04Pt-0.36Zn-DeAlBEA at various resolutions are presented in Figure 3AF."
[2] "We now report a novel strategy for the design, synthesis, and characterization of a zeolite-supported propane dehydrogenation catalyst that incorporates predominantly isolated Pt atoms stably bonded within nests of Zn atoms located within the nanoscale pores of dealuminated zeolite Beta."  
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates dealuminated zeolite BEA as a support for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It uses dealuminated BEA to synthesize 0.04Pt-0.36Zn-DeAlBEA, which incorporates isolated Pt atoms bonded within Zn atom nests in the pores of the zeolite. This catalyst exhibits high propene selectivity and stability for propane dehydrogenation.
