Abstract
The effect of Sn content on the activity and selectivity for hydrogen-assisted 1,2-dichloroethane dechlorination catalyzed by PtSn/SiO2 catalysts prepared via controlled surface reaction (CSR) has been investigated. For catalysts with a Pt/Sn atomic ratio greater than unity, the major and minor reaction products are ethane and ethyl chloride, respectively. As the ratio is decreased, the ethylene selectivity increases from zero to almost 90% at a Pt/Sn ratio of 0.8; concomitantly, the activity expressed as a turnover frequency decreases by a factor of 5. Each Sn-rich catalyst (Pt/Sn  1) exhibits a transient period (5110 h) during which sites for olefin formation are created. In situ 119Sn Mssbauer spectroscopic investigations of the PtSn/SiO2 catalyst with a Pt/Sn atomic ratio of 0.5 showed that all Sn in the reduced sample is incorporated into Sn-rich and Pt-rich PtSn alloys; the latter phase predominates. In contrast, a reduced PtSn/SiO2 catalyst with the same overall composition but prepared by co-impregnation contains Sn2+ and Sn4+ ions in addition to the metallic Sn that is incorporated into PtSn alloys. The CSR catalyst exhibits a higher initial selectivity toward ethylene than the co-impregnated catalyst (66 and 5%, respectively, after reduction at 623 K), whereas the steady-state ethylene selectivity is higher for the co-impregnated sample (91 and 75%, respectively). These results are discussed in terms of the different genesis and microstructures of the CSR and co-impregnated PtSn/SiO2 catalysts.

1. Introduction
Additives such as Sn play an essential role in controlling the activity, selectivity, and stability of many noble metals used to catalyze reactions such as hydrocarbon reforming [1], [2], oxidation of methanol [3], [4] and CO [5], [6], [7], oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes [8], [9], [10], [11], selective catalytic reduction of NOx with hydrocarbons [12], [13], olefin hydroformylation [14], and selective hydrogenation of nitriles [15] and 
-unsaturated aldehydes [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. It has also been shown that the addition of Sn to Pt improves the catalytic performance for hydrogen-assisted dechlorination reactions such as 1,2-dichloroethane conversion to ethylene [6], [21] and 1,2,3-trichloropropane conversion to propylene and/or allyl chloride [22].
Although many investigations have been conducted [5], [17], [19], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], the mechanism by which Sn improves the performance of Group VIII noble metals in various reactions is still a matter of debate. Indeed, the PtSn system is complex: five intermetallic compounds are thermodynamically stable [34]. Moreover, different Sn(II) and Sn(IV) ion-containing species may form [6], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40]. Thus, it is extremely challenging to determine the impact of each particular species on the overall catalyst performance, especially because the type of surface species present under conditions of real catalysis depends on the reaction conditions. Moreover, bimetallic catalysts prepared by sequential or co-impregnation of the support with a solution of inorganic metal salts are plagued by inhomogeneity [36], [41].
In a previous investigation kinetics results were correlated with Mssbauer studies of impregnated PtSn/SiO2 catalysts [21]. It was concluded that the Sn-rich PtSn alloy particles are responsible for ethylene formation in hydrogen-assisted 1,2-dichloroethane dechlorination, whereas Pt and Pt-rich PtSn species catalyze the formation of ethane. However, the role of ionic Sn in the PtSn/SiO2 catalysts for the hydrogen-assisted conversion of vicinal chlorocarbons has yet to be addressed. It has been suggested that ionic Sn species modify significantly the catalytic performance of Pt in the reactions of hydrocarbon hydroconversion [42], 
-unsaturated aldehyde-selective hydrogenation [19], [25], and low-temperature CO oxidation [5], [7], [19], [43].
To understand the role of ionic Sn species in PtSn-catalyzed dechlorination reactions, two different preparation procedures were used in the present investigation to vary the interaction between Pt and Sn: conventional co-impregnation and an organometallic method utilizing a controlled surface reaction (CSR) between hydrogen adsorbed to silica-supported Pt and tetraethyl tin [19], [44], [45], [46], [47]. In contrast to co-impregnation methods, organometallic methods employing CSR ensure the formation of exclusively bimetallic moieties on the surface of the support [19], [44], [47], [48]. The PtSn interactions in the PtSn/SiO2 catalysts with the same overall composition but prepared via different procedures were characterized by 119Sn Mssbauer spectroscopy. The results were linked to the catalytic performance in hydrogen-assisted 1,2-dichloroethane dechlorination.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation and routine characterization
Davisil-grade 645 (60100 mesh, surface area 300 m2g1, average pore diameter 150 Å, pore volume 1.15 cm3g1) silica gel (Aldrich, 99+%) was used as a support. Two monometallic Pt/SiO2 catalysts with metal loading of 0.4 and 0.7% (Galbraith Laboratories) were prepared by pore volume impregnation of the support with aqueous solutions of H2PtCl6  6H2O (Alfa, 99.9%). The slurry was equilibrated overnight before drying at ambient temperature and pressure for 72 h, followed by further drying at 373 K for 2 h under vacuum (
).
A bimetallic PtSn/SiO2 catalyst with a Pt/Sn atomic ratio of 0.5 (sample T-0.5, Table 1) was prepared by pore volume co-impregnation of the silica support with a solution of H2PtCl6  6H2O (Alfa, 99.9%) and SnCl2  2H2O (Aldrich, 98%) in 1 N aqueous HCl. The drying procedure was the same as that used for the Pt/SiO2 catalysts. The Pt and Sn loadings in the reduced catalyst were 0.4 and 0.5%, respectively (Galbraith Laboratories, Table 1). More details of the co-impregnation preparation procedure can be found elsewhere [21].

The 0.4% Pt/SiO2 and 0.7% Pt/SiO2 catalysts were used as the starting materials for the preparation of the PtSn/SiO2 catalysts by means of CSR (N-series, Table 1). The Pt/SiO2 catalyst was reduced by flowing H2 (30 mlmin1) at 573 K for 1 h. After reduction the catalyst was cooled to room temperature in the H2 flow and then purged with Ar (30 mlmin1) for 30 min to remove the physisorbed H2. Next, the catalyst was transferred into a glass reactor without exposure to air and slurried with deoxygenated benzene in an Ar atmosphere. The slurry was heated from room temperature to 323 K. At 323 K the Sn anchoring reaction was started by injecting tetraethyl tin into the slurry:
(1)PtHads + Sn(C2H5)4  PtSn(C2H5)4x + xC2H6.
The extent of reaction (1) was determined from the change in concentration of C2H6 both in the gas phase and in the slurry and from the change in the Sn(C2H5)4 concentration in the slurry measured with a gas chromatograph (GC). The GC was equipped with a 3-m Al2O3 packed column operated at 373 K to quantify C2H6 and a 1.5-m SiO2/10% Silicon 410 packed column operated at 433 K to quantify Sn(C2H5)4. When reaction (1) reached completion, the catalyst was washed at 323 K four times with benzene and twice with n-hexane. Then, the catalyst was dried in vacuum (5 Torr) for 1 h at the same temperature. This procedure was used to prepare the catalyst with a Pt/Sn ratio of 2.5 (N-2.5).
The CSR catalyst N-1.7 was prepared with the use of H2 as the reaction medium instead of Ar to increase the amount of anchored Sn [45]. For the preparation of the N-1.0, N-0.6, and N-0.5 catalysts, the Sn anchoring was started in H2; 150 min after the beginning of the anchoring procedure, the H2 was replaced with Ar. Then, a small amount of O2 (20 cm3/gcat) was added to the reactor, and the Sn anchoring was continued. Previous research has shown that O2 addition substantially increases the amount of Sn anchored [45]. For the N-0.8 catalyst two sequential Sn anchorings were performed. The first anchoring by the same procedure as applied for the preparation of the N-1.0, N-0.6, and N-0.5 catalysts with subsequent reduction at 623 K resulted in a Pt/Sn atomic ratio of 0.9. The second anchoring was also conducted in H2 but without the addition of O2, and it resulted in a final Pt/Sn ratio of 0.8. The Sn anchoring (reaction (1)) was conducted for 38 h. To increase the amount of anchored Sn, a sufficiently longer reaction time was used compared with earlier work [44], [49], [50].
The decomposition of the PtSn(C2H5)4x surface complex was conducted in flowing H2 (30 mlmin1) during heating from 298 to 623 K at a rate of 5 Kmin1 with 2 g of the catalyst in the reactor:
(2)PtSn(C2H5)4x + (4x)/2H2  PtSn + (4x)C2H6
and/or
(3)PtSn(C2H5)4x  PtSn + (4x)/2C2H6  + (4x)/2C2H4.
The decomposition products (C2H6 and C2H4) were quantified by a GC equipped with a 3-m Al2O3 packed column. After decomposition the Sn loading in the catalysts was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy.
Carbon monoxide chemisorption measurements were conducted at 308 K within a CO pressure range of 100500 Torr with a volumetric sorption analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2010). Prior to the measurement, the catalyst was reduced in flowing H2 (30 mlmin1) at 573 K for 2 h followed by reduction at 623 K for 1 h. Then, the system was evacuated at 623 K and cooled to the measurement temperature. The adsorbate/metal ratios were determined from the amount of irreversibly adsorbed CO (Table 1); the adsorption stoichiometry was assumed to be 1 [51]. All chemisorption measurements were conducted at least twice, and the reproducibility was better than 
.
2.2. Hydrogen-assisted 1,2-dichloroethane dechlorination
The dechlorination of CH2ClCH2Cl was conducted at ambient pressure in a stainless-steel flow reaction system connected to a quartz microreactor (10 mm i.d.) in which the catalyst was supported on a quartz frit. The reactor zone containing the catalyst was heated by an electric furnace. The catalyst temperature was measured and controlled with an accuracy of 
 with a temperature controller (Omega model CN2011). The gaseous reactants were metered with mass flow controllers (Brooks, 5850E) and mixed before they were introduced into the reactor. The liquid CH2ClCH2Cl (SigmaAldrich, 99.8%) was maintained in a saturator at 
 with a recirculating cooling system (RTE-7/Digital 1, Thermo NESLAB) and metered into the reaction system via He carrier gas. Saturation was confirmed by varying the flow rate of He through the saturator and quantifying the CH2ClCH2Cl in the gas phase with a GC (Varian 3300 series).
The reactor effluent was analyzed by on-line GC and, when necessary, by GC/MS to identify the reaction products. The GC was equipped with a 3-m 60/80 Carbopack B/5% Fluorocol packed column (Supelco) and a flame ionization detector (FID) capable of detecting concentrations greater than 1 ppm for all chlorocarbons and hydrocarbons involved in this study. The on-line HP GC/MS system consisted of a HP 5890 Series II Plus GC equipped with a Fluorocol column connected to a HP 5972 series mass-selective detector. Hydrogen chloride, a reaction product, was detected by GC/MS but was not quantified.
Prior to reaction the catalyst was exposed to flowing He (Praxair, 99.999%, 30 mlmin1) while heating from 303 to 403 K at a rate of 7 Kmin1 and then held at 403 K for 60 min. Then, the gas stream was switched to a mixture of H2 (Praxair, 99.999%, 10 mlmin1) and He (50 mlmin1). Next, the catalyst was heated from 403 K to the reduction temperature (493 or 623 K) for 30 min and held at this temperature for 90 min. Last, the catalyst was quickly cooled in He (50 mlmin1) to the reaction temperature.
For a typical dechlorination reaction, 0.15 g of catalyst was used and the total flow of reactant mixture was 16 mlmin1. The flow consisted of CH2ClCH2Cl (7300 ppm), H2 (36,800 ppm), and He (balance). The reaction temperature was 473 K. The catalyst mass and reactant mixture flow rate were adjusted to maintain the conversion in a narrow range (0.5 to 1.1%) so that the selectivity patterns could be compared. The turnover frequency (TOF) values were calculated with the use of the fraction of exposed Pt atoms determined from CO chemisorption measurements. All kinetics experiments were conducted at least twice, and the reproducibility was better than 
.
2.3. Mssbauer spectroscopy
The 119Sn Mssbauer spectra were recorded at 77 K in an in situ cell [52] with a pellet supported on a thin Be plate. The pellet was made from a powdered catalyst sample (ca. 0.7 g) by pressing the sample at 100 MPa for 3 min. Spectra were obtained for the as-prepared samples, for the samples after reduction in flowing H2 at 493 K, and after a second reduction of the same sample at 623 K (2 h, 10 mlmin1, ambient pressure for both reductions). The last spectrum for each sample was collected after exposure of the reduced catalyst to a flow of CH2Clsingle bondCH2Cl + H2 + N2 (1:5:25, 13 mlmin1, ambient pressure) at 473 K for 24 h. The exposure time was chosen to provide a quasi-steady-state catalyst performance for 1,2-dichloroethane dechlorination. The cell was sealed in the specific treatment gas after each step and cooled to the measurement temperature.
The constant acceleration Mssbauer spectra were collected with a KFKI spectrometer and a Ba119mSnO3 source (300 MBq). For fitting purposes a Lorentzian line shape for each peak was assumed, and no isomer shift parameters were initially constrained. Successive iterations were applied to obtain a better fit to the experimental data. The estimated accuracy of the positional parameters was 0.03 mms1. The isomer shift values were determined relative to the value for SnO2 (room temperature).
3. Results
3.1. Routine catalyst characterization
The CO/Pt ratio for the Pt-0.4 and Pt-0.7 catalysts was 61 and 58%, respectively (Table 1). For N-2.5, N-1.7, N-0.5, and T-0.5, the CO/Pt ratio was between 16 and 18%. The lowest CO/Pt ratio (5%) was observed for the N-0.8 catalyst; for the N-1.0 and N-0.6 samples it was approximately 10% (Table 1).
The N-0.5 and T-0.5 catalysts were analyzed for Cl. The residual Cl content was 0.1% for both samples after reduction at 493 K. Exposure of the N-0.5 sample to the ClCH2single bondCH2Cl + H2 reaction mixture at 473 K for 65 h did not change the Cl concentration. However, the Cl concentration of the T-0.5 sample increased by a factor of 4 to 0.4% after 65 h on stream at 473 K (Table 1).
3.2. Kinetics experiments
The catalytic performance of supported Pt for the CH2Clsingle bondCH2Cl + H2 reaction is well documented [21], [53], and thus the parent Pt/SiO2 catalysts were not tested. According to the literature, the steady-state TOF of Pt/SiO2 is in the range of 
 to 
, depending on the metal loading [21], [53]. A 0.5% Pt/SiO2 catalyst deactivated during the first 20 h on stream, and the 1,2-dichloroethane conversion decreased by a factor of 2.5. At longer time on stream the deactivation was insignificant [53]. With a 1.8% Pt/SiO2 catalyst the conversion decreased by almost one order of magnitude during the first 100 h on stream [21]. The different extent of deactivation accounts for the different steady-state TOFs of the 0.5% Pt/SiO2 and 1.8% Pt/SiO2 catalysts. Monometallic Pt catalysts do not catalyze hydrogen-assisted 1,2-dichloroethane dechlorination to form ethylene; ethane and monochloroethane are the only reaction products [21], [53]. Monometallic Sn catalysts exhibit no activity in the reaction [21].
With each bimetallic catalyst the conversion decreased during the first 0.7 h on stream; the total decrease during this time ranged from 42 to 81% (not shown). At longer times on stream the deactivation rate was 03% every 5 h. The highest deactivation was for the N-2.5 and N-1.7 catalystsapproximately 3% every 5 h. For the other bimetallic catalysts, there was essentially no deactivation with time on stream after the initial decrease (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The steady-state TOFs of the PtSn/SiO2 catalysts varied from 
 to 
, depending on the Pt/Sn atomic ratio (Table 2). Specifically, the TOF gradually decreased as the Pt/Sn ratio decreased until it became essentially invariant at Pt/Sn atomic ratios equal to or less than 0.6 (Table 2).

Decreasing the Pt/Sn atomic ratio also resulted in an increase in the steady-state selectivity toward ethylene (Table 2). Monometallic Pt and PtSn catalysts with higher Pt/Sn ratios (N-2.5 and N-1.7) yielded ethane (9697%) and ethyl chloride (34%). At a Pt/Sn ratio of 1 (N-1.0), ethane was the major product (64%) and the balance was ethylene. For the N-0.8, N-0.6, and N-0.5 catalysts, the major product was ethylene (7887%) and the balance was ethane. During the transient period the ethylene selectivity of the bimetallic catalysts with a Pt/Sn ratio less than or equal to 1 increased substantially at the expense of ethane (Fig. 1, Fig. 2).
The time on stream performances of the catalysts with a Pt/Sn ratio of 0.5 prepared by co-impregnation (sample T-0.5) and by CSR (sample N-0.5) are compared in Fig. 2. The initial and steady-state product selectivities and the steady-state TOF values are shown in Table 2. At steady state both catalysts yielded ethylene as the major product and ethane as the minor product. However, the T-0.5 sample showed a significant improvement in selectivity toward ethylene with time on stream at the expense of ethane. Specifically, after reduction at 493 K the selectivity toward ethylene increased from 11 to 88% during 64 h on stream (Fig. 2A). For the N-0.5 sample the steady-state selectivity toward ethylene at the expense of ethane was reached during a shorter time period (10 h) with smaller range of improvement (from 66 initially to 85% at steady state).
For the T-0.5 catalyst, increasing the reduction temperature to 623 K decreased by half the time required to achieve steady state; however, the steady-state selectivity was similar to that obtained after reduction at 493 K (88 and 91% for the 493 and 623 K reductions, respectively). For the N-0.5 sample, reduction at 623 K rather than 493 K did not significantly affect the time necessary to achieve steady state. But, the selectivity toward ethylene was only 75%, whereas it was 85% after reduction at 493 K. The TOF values, which were ca. 15% less for the N-0.5 sample than for the T-0.5 sample, were unaffected by the reduction temperature.
3.3. 119Sn Mssbauer spectroscopy
The 119Sn Mssbauer study was performed with the N-0.5 and T-0.5 catalysts, which have the same overall composition but were prepared by different methods. The spectra are shown in Fig. 3, and the parameters of the spectra are summarized in Table 3.

Catalysts were stored in air.
The Mssbauer spectrum of the as-prepared impregnated sample (T-0.5) consisted of a quadrupole doublet with a splitting of 0.50 mms1 and an isomer shift (IS) of 0.07 mms1 (Table 3). These parameters are characteristic of Sn4+ with Cl and O ligands [54]. Thus, even though the Sn precursor used to prepare the catalyst was SnCl2, the Sn2+ oxidized to Sn4+ during storage of the catalysts, which is expected from the chemistry of Sn2+ compounds [55].
The spectrum of the as-prepared CSR sample (N-0.5) consisted of a quadrupole doublet of Sn4+ (IS = 0.02 mms1 and QS = 0.64 mms1) and a singlet with an IS of 1.63 mms1. The latter value is close to that of a Pt3Sn alloy (1.50 mms1 [56]). Apparently alloying between Pt and Sn occurs under the conditions used to decompose the surface PtSn(C2H5)4x complex (Eqs. (2), (3)). Whereas the Pt3Sn alloy is stable during catalyst storage and/or exposure to air, the Sn-rich PtSn alloy phase oxidizes into Sn4+.
A characteristic feature of the reduced CSR sample (N-0.5) is the absence of ionic Sn species; the spectra contain only bands characteristic of PtSn alloys (Fig. 3A, Table 3). However, the features of the Mssbauer spectra of the reduced impregnated catalyst (T-0.5) suggest the presence of three forms of Sn: Sn4+ species (IS = 0.380.54 mms1), Sn2+ species (IS = 3.954.15 mms1), and PtSn alloys (IS = 1.112.53 mms1) [35], [37], [39], [40], [56], with a significant fraction of Sn alloyed with Pt (Table 3). The Sn2+ Mssbauer parameters were almost independent of the catalyst pretreatment and coincided with those for SnCl2 [57]. The variation in the IS of the Sn4+ species for the reduced samples suggests that the environment of the Sn4+ ions depends on the reduction temperature [54], [57]. Quadrupole splitting (QS) was not constrained for the Sn4+ species during deconvolution of the spectra. The QS of SnCl4 is zero [57], and for SnO2 it is 0.50.7 mms1 [35], [36], [37], a value very close to the line width of the 119Sn source (0.63 mms1 [57]). Thus, when the relative intensity of the Sn4+ band was less than 2030%, including a QS parameter did not increase the quality of the fit.
As already mentioned, the broad band in the range of 13 mms1 indicates that both the T-0.5 and the N-0.5 catalyst contained several PtSn alloy phases (Fig. 3). The Mssbauer spectra were fit under the assumption of a two-alloy component system: a Pt-rich alloy (PtSn(a)) with an IS of 1.1 to 1.7 mms1 and a Sn-rich alloy (PtSn(b)) with an IS of 2.1 to 2.6 mms1. The compositional changes in the PtSn alloy species were estimated from the IS value with the assumption of proportionality between the IS and the Pt/Sn atomic ratio [56].
The changes in relative intensities (RIs) of the spectral components corresponding to the different Sn species and the changes in the composition of PtSn alloys that resulted from different pretreatments for the T-0.5 and N-0.5 catalysts are described below. The RIs do not strictly correspond to concentration because the probability of the Mssbauer effect (recoilless fraction) varies with type of Sn species [57], [58]. In general, recoilless fractions for inorganic Sn2+ and Sn4+ compounds are less than those for PtSn alloys [58], [59]. Thus, the relative concentrations of ionic Sn species determined solely from the RIs would be underestimated, and those of PtSn alloy species would be overestimated. The total spectral area relative to the base line for the impregnated catalyst (T-0.5) increased significantly after each reduction and after exposure to the reaction mixture (Table 3). This increase may be associated with agglomeration of the Sn4+ at elevated temperatures as the recoilless fraction for bulk SnO2 is larger than that for the surface Sn4+ ions [6]. The total spectral area for the CSR catalyst (N-0.5) was independent of the catalyst pretreatment, probably because Sn4+ moieties were absent in the reduced samples prepared by CSR.
For the PtSn/SiO2 catalyst prepared by co-impregnation (T-0.5), the IS and RI values were similar for the Sn-rich PtSn alloy phase after reduction of the catalyst at 493 K and after exposure to the reaction mixture. Each IS of the alloy after these treatments exceeded that for the PtSn4 phase (2.29 mms1 [56]). Reduction at 623 K resulted in a 13% higher RI and a lower IS (2.16 mms1, which corresponds to the PtSn2 phase [56]). A similar trend was observed for the Pt-rich PtSn alloy phaseincreasing the reduction temperature from 493 to 623 K decreased the IS from 1.39 to 1.11 mms1. The IS increased to 1.22 mms1 after the reduced catalyst was exposed to the reaction mixture. (Isomer shifts below 1.40 mms1 correspond to diluted solutions of Sn in Pt [56].) In addition, exposure of the catalyst to the reaction mixture doubled the RI of the Pt-rich PtSn alloy phase with respect to the value measured after the two reductions (from ca. 20 to 43%). When the reduction temperature was increased from 473 to 623 K, the RI of the band corresponding to ionic tin decreased from 29 to 18%. And then it decreased to 5% after exposure to the reaction mixture.
For the PtSn/SiO2 catalyst prepared by controlled surface reaction (N-0.5), the IS for the Sn-rich alloy phase was almost independent of the type of treatments: reduction at 493 K, reduction at 623 K, and exposure to the reaction mixture at 473 K (Table 3). Similar to the T-0.5 catalyst, the IS of the alloy after these treatments exceeded that of PtSn4 [56]. The relative intensity of the band for the Sn-rich alloy phase decreased from 25 to 20% when the catalyst reduction temperature was increased from 493 to 623 K. But, exposure to the reaction mixture resulted in an increase in the RI of the Sn-rich alloy band to 37%. Correspondingly, the relative band intensity for the Pt-rich alloy phase increased with increasing catalyst reduction temperature, but it decreased after exposure of the reduced catalyst to the reaction mixture at 493 K. The IS values of the Pt-rich phase after reduction at 493 K and exposure to the reaction mixture at 473 K (1.231.38 mms1, Table 3) are indicative of a low concentration (
) of metallic tin dissolved in Pt. However, after reduction at 623 K the IS of the Pt-rich phase (1.51 mms1) corresponded to the Pt3Sn stoichiometry [56].
4. Discussion
The positive effect of Sn addition on the performance of Pt hydrocarbon reforming catalysts has fueled debates about the appropriate molecular-level description to account for the role of Sn [1], [2]. Both Snn+ (
, 4) species and metallic Sn alloyed with Pt have been suggested to be responsible for the improvement of the catalytic properties of Pt. For Snn+ a mechanism was proposed in which there is an electronic interaction between highly dispersed Pt particles and Sn ions bound to the support [60], [61], [62], [63]. For metallic Sn alloyed with Pt, it was proposed that the Sn atoms serve as spacers that split the Pt ensembles and thereby suppress the size-demanding reactions such as hydrogenolysis; thus, the role of Sn in this case is viewed as entirely geometric [29], [64], [65]. Electronic modification of Pt alloyed with Sn was found to be insignificant [1], [65], [66], [67], although theoretical consideration of the PtSn bonding in PtSn surface alloys suggests a 
 charge transfer and a Pt(5
 Pt
 rehybridization that localize electrons between the metal centers [68], [69].
The exceptional performance of PtSn catalysts in reactions such as the activation of Cdouble bondO bonds (CO oxidation [5], [6], [7], olefin hydroformylation [14], selective hydrogenation of 
-unsaturated aldehydes [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]) stimulated further discussion about the mechanism by which Sn modifies the catalytic performance of Pt. It was proposed that the Sn ions of PtSnn+ sites interact as a Lewis acid with the oxygen atom of the Cdouble bondO bond, thereby activating the carbonyl group [25]. The Sn ions that strongly interact with the support are always present in reduced catalysts prepared by impregnation [6], [21], [27], [35], [36], [37], [39], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75]. Some of them may be located at the Pt-support interface to form the PtSnn+ moieties. For the PtSn catalysts prepared by the controlled surface reaction method in which all Sn is deposited on the surface of Pt particles and reduces to Sn0, it was proposed that partially polarized species such as PtδSnδ+ serve as active sites for reactions of carbonyl compounds [25]. However, it was also shown that Snn+ species are present in reduced organometallic catalysts [6], [20], [76], [77]. Furthermore, a fraction of Sn on the surface of PtSn alloys is oxidized by the CO + O2 reaction mixture in the case of CO oxidation [6], [43] or by the 
-unsaturated aldehyde in the case of aldehyde hydrogenation [78]. The participation of Snn+ ions in CO bond activation results in an increase in the reaction rate for CO oxidation reaction [5], [6], [7]; for 
-unsaturated aldehyde hydrogenation the presence of Snn+ ions in the PtSn catalyst improves the selectivity toward 
-unsaturated alcohols (Cdouble bondO bond hydrogenation) as opposed to saturated aldehydes (Cdouble bondC bond hydrogenation) [17], [18], [19], [20].
A mechanism similar to the activation of the Cdouble bondO group of carbonyl compounds appears to be appropriate for the activation of Csingle bondCl bonds. The interaction of Cl atoms (Lewis bases) of 1,2-dichloroethane with Sn2+ ions (Lewis acids) weakens both Csingle bondCl bonds of a vicinal halocarbon to favor bond dissociation:
(4)  PtSn4+Cl2 + CH2double bondCH2,
PtSn4+Cl2 + 2Hads  PtSn2+ + 2HCl.
The two Csingle bondCl bonds of the 1,2-dichloroethane molecule dissociate, which results in the formation of ethylene and the oxidation of the Sn2+ ion to Sn4+. As ethylene does not interact strongly with Snn+ ions (as well as with Sn metal), it immediately desorbs into the gas phase. The dissociation of H2 occurs on the Pt sites. And the H atoms diffuse from Pt sites to reduce the Sn4+ to Sn2+ to complete the catalytic cycle. In fact, intimate contact between Pt and Snn+ ions is not required because spillover provides the flux of H atoms necessary to reduce the Sn4+ ions. However, the dissociation of Csingle bondCl bonds also occurs on Sn0 [79]. If the Sn0 species participate as sites for Csingle bondCl bond dissociation, a mechanistic scheme for the dechlorination reaction could be written as follows:
(5)  PtSn2+Cl2 + CH2double bondCH2,
PtSn2+Cl2 + 2Hads  PtSn0 + 2HCl.
If 1,2-dichloroethane dissociates on Pt sites, ethane forms as a reaction product [80]. Ethylene adsorbs strongly on Pt [81], [82], [83] and is hydrogenated to ethane rather than desorbs as ethylene.
A comparison of the catalytic performances of the two PtSn/SiO2 catalysts with the same overall composition but prepared differently provides insight into the viability of the reaction mechanisms shown schematically by Eqs. (4), (5).
A characteristic performance feature of the co-impregnation catalyst (T-0.5) is the transient period in terms of ethylene selectivity (Table 2, Fig. 2). At early time on stream, the catalyst exhibits relatively low selectivity toward ethylene, which increases substantially during the course of the reaction. The Mssbauer results show that a significant fraction of Sn in the reduced catalyst incorporates into a PtSn alloy with a PtSn stoichiometry (diluted solid solution of Sn in Pt) (Table 3). Similar to pure Pt, the PtSn alloy catalyzes 1,2-dichloroethane dechlorination to form ethane, whereas the Sn-rich PtSn alloy is responsible for the ethylene formation [21]. The fraction of Sn in the PtSn alloy increases after 24 h on stream (Table 3), in parallel with an increase in the ethylene selectivity (Fig. 3, Table 3). This indicates that the relative impact of the PtSn phase in the impregnated catalyst (T-0.5) on the catalytic performance decreases with time on stream.
The inhomogeneity of supported bimetallic catalysts prepared by co-impregnation [36], [41] allows for the possibility that the reduced catalyst contains a fraction of unalloyed Pt (or PtSn particles with very low Sn concentration) in addition to the PtSn alloy species. As the dechlorination reaction proceeds, the Pt alloys with Sn that remained in an oxidized state after catalyst reduction to increase the concentration of Sn in both the PtSn and Sn-rich PtSn alloy (the IS of both the PtSn(a) and PtSn(b) species is greater after exposure of the catalyst to reaction mixture than after reduction at 623 K (Table 3)). Table 3 shows that the fraction of ionic Sn does indeed decrease after the reduced catalyst is exposed to the reaction mixture. As alloying of a PtSn particle with the additional Sn starts from the surface, the concentration of Sn on the surface of the particle can be significantly higher than the Sn concentration in the bulk of the particle.
There is also the possibility of a true surface enrichment in Sn that should be more pronounced for the Pt-rich PtSn species. This enrichment occurs at the expense of the bulk Sn concentration and is enhanced by exposure to the reaction mixture. Surface segregation of alloys during exposure to different gaseous media is not uncommon [84], [85]. Indeed, surface enrichment in Sn of the outermost surface layers of bulk PtSn alloys has been demonstrated [86], [87], [88], [89]. The driving force for surface enrichment of PtSn alloys in Sn during the dechlorination reaction is the difference in affinity of Pt and Sn toward Cl. Specifically, 
 is 
 for SnCl2 and 
 for PtCl2 [90]. Thus, the alloying of an additional amount of Sn with PtSn species during the dechlorination reaction and surface enrichment in Sn explain the transient behavior of the impregnated T-0.5 catalyst with respect to ethylene selectivity (Fig. 3); the ethylene selectivity increases with increasing surface concentration of Sn.
The samples prepared by CSR (N-series) also exhibit transient behavior during the CH2Clsingle bondCH2Cl + H2 reaction (Fig. 1, Fig. 2; Table 2), although the magnitude of the selectivity change with time on stream is much lower than for the impregnated catalysts. Preparation by controlled surface reaction ensures exclusive interaction of Sn(C2H5)4 with Pt particles [19], [45], [47], [91]. Indirect evidence that all Sn in the organometallic catalysts interacts with Pt is provided by the Mssbauer results, showing that the reduced CSR sample (N-0.5) does not contain ionic Sn (Table 3). Thus, the increase in ethylene selectivity with time on stream for the CSR samples cannot be explained by the same mechanism as that for the impregnated T-0.5 sample in which the fraction of Sn that remained in the oxidized state after catalyst reduction reduces to the metal during the dechlorination reaction and alloys with Pt to increase the Sn/Pt atomic ratio in the bimetallic particles and, hence, the ethylene selectivity.
The essence of the CSR technique is that the Sn organic moieties are deposited on the surface of Pt particles layer by layer [45]. The number of the layers is not a function of the Pt particle size. (Metal particles in supported catalysts are always inhomogeneous with regard to size.) And, therefore, the Sn/Pt atomic ratio for smaller particles will be higher than that for larger particles. During decomposition of the surface PtSn complex, Sn atoms sink in the bulk of the Pt particles to form PtSn alloys. Thus, the particles with a lower Sn/Pt atomic ratio have a lower Sn concentration on the surface, and these particles catalyze 1,2-dichloroethane dechlorination to ethane. Exposure of the reduced catalyst to the reaction mixture triggers the process of surface enrichment in Sn, and ethylene selectivity increases. However, there may be particles that do not have enough Sn to turn into ethylene-selective entities, even though all of the Sn accumulates on the particle surface. Ultimately, the ongoing surface enrichment in Sn leads to cherry-like particles with Pt-rich PtSn alloy or even a monometallic Pt core surrounded by Sn-rich PtSn alloy.
A higher reduction temperature or a longer reduction time at a fixed temperature favors more homogeneous PtSn particles with respect to the Sn and Pt distribution in the particle bulk. But, reduction with H2 favors surface enrichment of bimetallic PtSn particles in Pt [77]. Thus, the lower ethylene selectivity of the CSR N-0.5 sample after reduction at 623 K than after reduction at 493 K (Fig. 2) can be attributed to the higher surface concentration of Pt after the reduction at a higher temperature. If diffusion of Sn and Pt in the PtSn alloys is slow, a longer time is required for the bimetallic particles to equilibrate with the reaction mixture with respect to surface Sn concentration at the reaction temperature (473 K).
For the impregnated samples the diffusion of Sn into bulk during high temperature reduction does not affect the surface concentration of Sn as significantly as it does for the CSR samples. About 30% of the Sn in the impregnated T-0.5 sample reduced at 493 K exists as Snn+ ions with O and/or Cl ligands (Table 3). These Sn moieties must be located sufficiently far from the Pt-containing particles that reduction to Sn and incorporation into a PtSn alloy do not occur during the limited time of reduction. Increasing the reduction temperature to 623 K results in a decrease in the Snn+ species concentration from 30 to 
. Hence, the decrease in the concentration of Sn on the surface of PtSn particles during catalyst reduction due to diffusion of Sn into the bulk is compensated for by a supply of additional Sn (that has been located on the support as Snn+ ions) to the particle surface. The fact that the concentration of ionic Sn decreases during the dechlorination reaction from 18 to 5% after 24 h on stream (Table 3) provides evidence that there is a flux of Sn toward the PtSn alloy particles during the dechlorination reaction. Thus, the concentration of Sn on the surface of PtSn particles is higher for the impregnated catalyst than for the CSR sample; this accounts for the higher steady-state ethylene selectivity of the T-0.5 sample than the N-0.5 catalyst (Fig. 3, Table 2).
The catalytic tests show that the activities of the impregnated (T-0.5) and CSR (N-0.5) samples in the 1,2-dichloroethane dechlorination reaction are the same within experimental error (Table 2). The absence of ionic Sn species in the CSR (N-0.5) sample exposed to the CH2Clsingle bondCH2Cl + H2 reaction mixture (Table 3) suggests that Sn2+ ions are not active species for 1,2-dichloroethane dechlorination, according to Eq. (4). If they were, the activity of the impregnated sample would be higher because the concentration of the Sn2+ ions after exposure to the reaction mixture is significant (5%, Table 3). Typically, the steady-state concentration of a reaction intermediate under conditions of real catalysis is low, and it is difficult to detect the intermediate by conventional characterization techniques. The fact that the Sn2+ species were identified for the impregnated (T-0.5) sample exposed to the reaction mixture suggests that these moieties are spectator species, most likely located far from the Pt-containing particles that dissociate H2. The presence of Sn2+ ions in the impregnated (T-0.5) sample would account for the higher concentration of Cl in the used impregnated sample than in the used CSR sample (Table 1), because Cl may serve as a ligand for ionic Sn species.
5. Conclusion
For the reaction of hydrogen-assisted 1,2-dichloroethane dechlorination, the catalytic performance of PtSn/SiO2 catalysts with different Pt/Sn atomic ratios prepared by controlled surface reaction with an organometallic Sn precursor has been compared with that of a PtSn/SiO2 catalyst prepared by co-impregnation. The application of controlled surface reaction technique to prepare PtSn/SiO2 catalysts results in the exclusive formation of PtSn bimetallic surface entities. Conversely, the co-impregnation preparation technique results in the stabilization of Sn2+ and Sn4+ moieties on the support surface in addition to the formation of PtSn alloys. Independent of the catalyst preparation method, the catalytic activity decreases with an increase in the Sn concentration, but it is approximately the same for catalysts with the same Pt/Sn atomic ratio.
Both the CSR and the impregnated catalysts with a Pt/Sn atomic ratio less than unity exhibit high steady-state selectivity toward ethylene; however, the selectivity typically increases with time on stream. The most dramatic selectivity increase was observed for the co-impregnated PtSn/SiO2 catalysts. Specifically, the ethylene selectivity for the catalyst with a Pt/Sn atomic ratio of 0.5 was 5% initially but increased to 91% in 35 h on stream. The transient behavior of the organometallic catalysts is explained by Sn enrichment of the PtSn particle surface during the course of the dechlorination reaction, as Sn-rich PtSn alloys are highly selective toward ethylene. The surface of PtSn particles of the co-impregnated PtSn/SiO2 catalysts is also enriched in Sn during the 1,2-dechlorination reaction, resulting in an increase in the ethylene selectivity; however, the enrichment occurs during the dechlorination reaction by incorporation of an additional amount of Sn that was present on the support in an oxidized state before the start of the reaction.
A mechanism of hydrogen-assisted 1,2-dichloroethane dechlorination catalyzed by PtSn/SiO2 was proposed. It consists of dissociation of both Csingle bondCl bonds of the 1,2-dichloroethane molecule on a Sn atom incorporated into a PtSn alloy. The dissociation results in the formation of an ethylene molecule and oxidation of Sn0 to Sn2+. Reduction of the Sn2+ ion with H atoms diffused from Pt to form Sn0 and HCl regenerates the active site, thereby completing the catalytic cycle.
