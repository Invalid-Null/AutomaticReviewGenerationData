<quotes>
[1] "The catalyst with the composition MoV0.4Nb0.1Te0.2Ox showed high activity and selectivity for propane ammoxidation reaction (ca. 50% selectivity to acrylonitrile at ca. 90% conversion) when it was pretreated at 830900 K for 2 h under O2-free or less than 100 ppm O2-contaminated N2 or He flow conditions."

[2] "In the presence of more than 1000 ppm O2 contamination during the pretreatment, α-MoO3 was formed at the surface region, resulting in reduction of the activity for propane ammoxidation."  

[3] "Active phases were characterized by XRD, which gave 2θ=14.1, 24.9, 26.9, 29.1, 32.4, 33.2, and 35.4 in addition to the peaks at 22.1, 28.2, 36.2, 44.7, and 50.0 reported previously."
