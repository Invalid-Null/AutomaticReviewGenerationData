         [1] "The catalyst with the composition MoV0.4Nb0.1Te0.2Ox showed high activity and selectivity for propane ammoxidation reaction (ca. 50% selectivity to acrylonitrile at ca. 90% conversion) when it was pretreated at 830900 K for 2 h under O2-free or less than 100 ppm O2-contaminated N2 or He flow conditions."
         [2] "In the presence of more than 1000 ppm O2 contamination during the pretreatment, α-MoO3 was formed at the surface region, resulting in reduction of the activity for propane ammoxidation."
         [3] "The catalytic performance and structures of multicomponent MoVNbTe oxides have been studied to find the correlation among the performance, active phases, and preparation conditions."
         [4] "Active phases were characterized by XRD, which gave 2θ=14.1, 24.9, 26.9, 29.1, 32.4, 33.2, and 35.4 in addition to the peaks at 22.1, 28.2, 36.2, 44.7, and 50.0 reported previously."

         Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses pretreating the MoVNbTe oxide catalyst composition at high temperatures under oxygen-free or low oxygen conditions to optimize activity and selectivity. XRD characterization of the active phases is also discussed. It also studies the correlation between catalytic performance, active phases, and preparation conditions for the catalyst.
