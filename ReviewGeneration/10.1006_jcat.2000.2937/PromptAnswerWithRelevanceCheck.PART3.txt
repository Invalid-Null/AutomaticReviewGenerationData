[1] "The catalyst with the composition MoV0.4Nb0.1Te0.2Ox showed high activity and selectivity for propane ammoxidation reaction (ca. 50% selectivity to acrylonitrile at ca. 90% conversion) when it was pretreated at 830900 K for 2 h under O2-free or less than 100 ppm O2-contaminated N2 or He flow conditions."

[2] "In the presence of more than 1000 ppm O2 contamination during the pretreatment, α-MoO3 was formed at the surface region, resulting in reduction of the activity for propane ammoxidation."

<English version answer>
3. Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies the effects of different pretreatment conditions on the formation of active phases in MoVNbTe oxide catalysts for propane ammoxidation. Pretreating under oxygen-free or low oxygen conditions results in high dispersion of active phases and high catalytic activity. But higher oxygen levels lead to aggregation of less active α-MoO3 phase and lower activity.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
3. 答:是的,文章研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它研究了不同的预处理条件对丙烷氨氧化MoVNbTe氧化物催化剂中活性相的形成的影响。在无氧或低氧条件下预处理可以得到高度分散的活性相和高的催化活性。但更高的氧浓度会导致较不活跃的α-MoO3相聚集和活性降低。
