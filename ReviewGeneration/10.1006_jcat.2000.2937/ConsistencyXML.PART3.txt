To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the provided answers in each file to the correct answers. I looked for similarities and differences in the key points made in the English and Chinese answers. More similar key points resulted in a higher consistency percentage. Some answers were fully consistent, while others differed in certain details or completeness resulting in slightly lower consistency scores. But overall most answered showed strong consistency with the correct answers.
