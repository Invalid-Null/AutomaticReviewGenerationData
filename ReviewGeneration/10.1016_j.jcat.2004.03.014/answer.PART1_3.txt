[1] It has been clarified that the structures of Cr-MCM-41 prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis and template-ion exchange by X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, diffuse reflectance UVvis, X-ray absorption (XANES and EXAFS), and UV-Raman spectroscopic measurements.
[2] Moreover, the two methods resulted in different locations of the accommodated metal cations: highly dispersed metal ions on the wall surface within MCM-41 mesopores for TIE, and monomeric metal species incorporated inside the framework of MCM-41 for DHT.
[3] It was suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method.

Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties affects propane dehydrogenation performance over Cr-MCM-41 catalysts. It shows that Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination as monochromates are the active sites, which get reduced to less active Cr(III) species in octahedral coordination as polychromates during reaction. The ability to reoxidize reduced Cr species back to Cr(VI) by oxygen or CO2 is critical for catalyst regeneration. The DHT synthesis method gives more monochromate active sites than TIE method.

答:是的,该文研究了如何调节氧化态、氧的运动性和酸碱性质以影响Cr-MCM-41催化剂上的丙烷脱氢性能。它显示Cr(VI)物种在四面体配位作为单铬酸盐时是活性位点,在反应过程中被还原为八面体配位的较不活跃的Cr(III)物种作为聚铬酸盐。用氧气或CO2将还原的Cr物种重新氧化回Cr(VI)对于催化剂再生至关重要。DHT合成方法产生的单铬酸盐活性位点比TIE方法更多。

[1] Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%.  
[2] It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction.
[3] It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra.

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over Cr-MCM-41 catalysts. It suggests Cr(VI) species as monochromates with tetrahedral coordination are the active sites that dehydrogenate propane to propene. In the process, they get reduced to less active Cr(III) species as polychromates with octahedral coordination. The reduced Cr(III) species can then be reoxidized back to active Cr(VI) species by O2 or CO2.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文提出了Cr-MCM-41催化剂上的丙烷脱氢的机制场景。它认为Cr(VI)物种作为四面体配位的单铬酸盐是活性位点,可以将丙烷脱氢为丙烯。在这个过程中,它们被还原为八面体��位的较不活跃的Cr(III)物种作为聚铬酸盐。还原的Cr(III)物种然后可以被O2或CO2氧化回活性Cr(VI)物种。
