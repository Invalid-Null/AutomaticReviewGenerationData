Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It introduces various metals like Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co into the MCM-41 support using direct hydrothermal synthesis with controlled template/silicone ratios. Cr-MCM-41 prepared this way shows high propene selectivity and yield. The article also prepares Cr catalysts on other supports like Cab-O-Sil and SiO2 via impregnation for comparison. UV-vis spectroscopy suggests Cr species are more dispersed on Cr-MCM-41 vs Cr/Cab-O-Sil.

Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAN and EXAFS) to probe oxidation state changes of chromium during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. The data reveal tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI) species are present before reaction, but change to aggregated octahedrally coordinated Cr(III) species after short reaction times, indicating reduction of active sites occurs. Treating spent catalyst with O2 regenerates the Cr(VI) sites, confirming the reduction-oxidation cycle happening during reaction.

[1] X-ray absorption spectroscopic measurements were performed with Synchrotron radiation at a beam-line BL7C station of the Photon Factory, at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (Tsukuba, Japan), operated at 2.5 GeV with about 35380 mA of ring current. 

[2] Cr-MCM-41-DHT showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%.

[3] The mechanism of catalyst deactivation as well as regeneration was discussed based on the structurecatalytic property relationships.

[4] X-ray absorption spectroscopic measurements were carried out with Synchrotron radiation at a beam-line BL7C station of the Photon Factory, at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (Tsukuba, Japan), operated at 2.5 GeV with about 35380 mA of ring current. 

[5] According to the Cr-K-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with a Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 8A, ad), a preedge peak was clearly observed before the reaction, while this peak was significantly weakened even after the reaction for 0.5 h and the edge position shifted to lower energy during the reaction, suggesting that the local symmetry around the chromium center has been changed from tetrahedral coordination to octahedral coordination during the reaction [43], [47].

Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows that Cr-MCM-41-DHT has the highest activity, with 30% propane conversion and over 90% propylene selectivity. It also reveals changes in chromium coordination during reaction, from tetrahedral Cr(VI) to octahedral Cr(III), indicating deactivation.

[2] In the results of Fourier transforms of k3-weighted Cr-K-edge EXAFS (Fig. 8B, a), a single peak was observed before the reaction and could be assigned to the bond of CrO, consisting of two CrO bonds and two CrO bonds in CrO4 tetrahedra (vide infra). After the reaction for 0.5 h (Fig. 8B, b), two distinct peaks appeared at 1.6 and 2.6 Å (non-phase-shift corrected) and the intensity of the latter peak increased, while that of the first one decreased, during the reaction (Fig. 8B, c and d). 

[3] The changes in both XANES (Fig. 10A, a and b) and the EXAFS (Fig. 10B, a and b) spectra indicate that the Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra were reduced to an aggregated form of the Cr(III)O6 octahedra during the reaction for 3 h. After the treatment with O2, the XANES (Fig. 10A, c) and the EXAFS spectra (Fig. 10B, c) showed a sharp preedge peak and a single peak, respectively, suggesting that the Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra were regenerated by the reoxidation of the Cr(III)O6 octahedra.

Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows changes in chromium coordination from Cr(VI) tetrahedra to Cr(III) octahedra during reaction, indicating deactivation. It also demonstrates reoxidation of octahedral Cr(III) back to active tetrahedral Cr(VI) after O2 or CO2 treatment.
