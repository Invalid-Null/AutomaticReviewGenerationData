[1] "Various metals (M=Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co) were introduced into MCM-41 by direct hydrothermal synthesis."

[2] "The molar ratio of the template to the silicone was kept at 0.5 in the synthesis gel for each synthesis."

[3] "Cr-MCM-41-DHT showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."

[4] "Cr/Cab-O-Sil and Cr/SiO2 catalysts were prepared by impregnation of nonporous Cab-O-Sil (M5, Acros Organics) and SiO2 (JRC-SIO-8, the reference catalyst provided by the Catalyst Society of Japan) as a support for comparison with Cr(III) nitrate."

[5] "UV bands at 280 and 370 nm, which could be assigned to OCr(VI) charge transfer of chromates species [46], were mainly observed for both samples. A weak shoulder around 440 nm assigned to Cr(VI) polychromate was observed for Cr-MCM-41-DHT."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It introduces various metals like Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co into the MCM-41 support using direct hydrothermal synthesis with controlled template/silicone ratios. Cr-MCM-41 prepared this way shows high propene selectivity and yield. The article also prepares Cr catalysts on other supports like Cab-O-Sil and SiO2 via impregnation for comparison. UV-vis spectroscopy suggests Cr species are more dispersed on Cr-MCM-41 vs Cr/Cab-O-Sil.

答:是的,本文研究了旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法。它使用直接水热合成法在受控的模板/硅橡胶比例下向MCM-41支持体中引入了各种金属,如Cr、Ga、Ni、V、Fe、Mn和Co。以这种方式制备的Cr-MCM-41显示出高的丙烯选择性和产率。文章还通过浸渍法在其他支持体如Cab-O-Sil和SiO2上制备Cr催化剂进行比较。紫外可见光谱表明Cr种类在Cr-MCM-41上的分散度比Cr/Cab-O-Sil上的分散度高。

[1] "X-ray absorption spectroscopic measurements were performed with Synchrotron radiation at a beam-line BL7C station of the Photon Factory, at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (Tsukuba, Japan), operated at 2.5 GeV with about 35380 mA of ring current." 

[2] "According to the Cr-K-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with a Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 8A, ad), a preedge peak was clearly observed before the reaction, while this peak was significantly weakened even after the reaction for 0.5 h and the edge position shifted to lower energy during the reaction, suggesting that the local symmetry around the chromium center has been changed from tetrahedral coordination to octahedral coordination during the reaction [43], [47]."

[3] "In the results of Fourier transforms of k3-weighted Cr-K-edge EXAFS (Fig. 8B, a), a single peak was observed before the reaction and could be assigned to the bond of CrO, consisting of two CrO bonds and two CrO bonds in CrO4 tetrahedra (vide infra)." 

[4] "After the reaction for 0.5 h (Fig. 8B, b), two distinct peaks appeared at 1.6 and 2.6 Å (non-phase-shift corrected) and the intensity of the latter peak increased, while that of the first one decreased, during the reaction (Fig. 8B, c and d)."

Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It performs measurements at a synchrotron radiation facility. The XANES and EXAFS data reveal that tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI) species are present before reaction, but change to octahedrally coordinated Cr(III) species after short reaction times, indicating reduction of active sites occurs during propane dehydrogenation. The coordination number and bond lengths of Cr-O shells are quantified using curve fitting.

答:是的,本文利用原位X射线吸收光谱研究工作中的丙烷脱氢催化剂。它在同步辐射设施中进行测量。XANES和EXAFS数据显示,在反应前存在四面体配位的Cr(VI)物种,但在短暂的反应时间后改变为八面体配位的Cr(III)物种,这表明活性位点在丙烷脱氢过程中发生了还原。通过曲线拟合定量了Cr-O壳层的配位数字和键长。

[4] "The changes in both XANES (Fig. 10A, a and b) and the EXAFS (Fig. 10B, a and b) spectra indicate that the Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra were reduced to an aggregated form of the Cr(III)O6 octahedra during the reaction for 3 h."

[5] "After the treatment with O2, the XANES (Fig. 10A, c) and the EXAFS spectra (Fig. 10B, c) showed a sharp preedge peak and a single peak, respectively, suggesting that the Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra were regenerated by the reoxidation of the Cr(III)O6 octahedra."

Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAN and EXAFS) to probe oxidation state changes of chromium during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. The data reveal tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI) species are present before reaction, but change to aggregated octahedrally coordinated Cr(III) species after short reaction times, indicating reduction of active sites occurs. Treating spent catalyst with O2 regenerates the Cr(VI) sites, confirming the reduction-oxidation cycle happening during reaction.

答:是的,本文使用X射线吸收光谱(XANES和EXAFS)来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中铬的氧化还原状态变化。数据显示四面体配位的Cr(VI)物种在反应前存在,但在短暂的反应时间后改变为聚集的八面体配位的Cr(III)物种,这表明活性位点发生了还原。用O2处理失活的催化剂可再生Cr(VI)位点,这证实了反应过程中存在还原-氧化循环。
