[1] "the reductionoxidation property and the appropriate dispersion of chromium species on the support are important in these catalytic reactions [5], [8]."

[2] "The changes in both XANES (Fig. 10A, a and b) and the EXAFS (Fig. 10B, a and b) spectra indicate that the Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra were reduced to an aggregated form of the Cr(III)O6 octahedra during the reaction for 3 h. After the treatment with O2, the XANES (Fig. 10A, c) and the EXAFS spectra (Fig. 10B, c) showed a sharp preedge peak and a single peak, respectively, suggesting that the Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra were regenerated by the reoxidation of the Cr(III)O6 octahedra."

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states and oxygen mobility of chromium species affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination as CrO4 is the active form, while reduced Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as CrO6 is less active. Reoxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) by O2 or CO2 treatment regenerates catalyst activity.

2. 是的,该文研究了调节铬物种的氧化态和氧迁移如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它表明四面体配位的Cr(VI)作为CrO4是活性形式,而减少的八面体配位的Cr(III)作为CrO6活性较低。用O2或CO2处理使Cr(III)再氧化为Cr(VI)可再生催化剂活性。

[1] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[2] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."

3. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario where tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI) as CrO4 serves as the active site that dehydrogenates propane to propene, while being reduced to less active octahedrally coordinated Cr(III) as CrO6. The Cr(III) species can then be reoxidized back to active Cr(VI) by O2 or CO2.

3. 是的,该文提出了一个机理场景,其中四面体配位的Cr(VI)作为CrO4充当活性位点,将丙烷脱氢为丙烯,同时被还原为活性较低的八面体配位的Cr(III),即CrO6。然后Cr(III)物种可以通过O2或CO2被再氧化回活性Cr(VI)。

7. No, since the article does not study supported metal catalysts, it does not propose mechanistic pathways for propane dehydrogenation over such catalysts. It only proposes a mechanism for Cr-MCM-41 involving Cr(VI)/Cr(III) redox cycling.  

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

7. 不,由于文章没有研究负载金属催化剂,它也不提出该类催化剂上的丙烷脱氢的机理途径。它仅提出了Cr-MCM-41上的机理,涉及Cr(VI)/ Cr(III)氧化还原循环。
