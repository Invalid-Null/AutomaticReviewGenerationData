<quotes>

[1] "the reductionoxidation property and the appropriate dispersion of chromium species on the support are important in these catalytic reactions [5], [8]."

[2] "The changes in both XANES (Fig. 10A, a and b) and the EXAFS (Fig. 10B, a and b) spectra indicate that the Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra were reduced to an aggregated form of the Cr(III)O6 octahedra during the reaction for 3 h. After the treatment with O2, the XANES (Fig. 10A, c) and the EXAFS spectra (Fig. 10B, c) showed a sharp preedge peak and a single peak, respectively, suggesting that the Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra were regenerated by the reoxidation of the Cr(III)O6 octahedra."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states and oxygen mobility of chromium species affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination as CrO4 is the active form, while reduced Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as CrO6 is less active. Reoxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) by O2 or CO2 treatment regenerates catalyst activity.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

2. 是的,该文研究了调节铬物种的氧化态和氧迁移如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它表明四面体配位的Cr(VI)作为CrO4是活性形式,而减少的八面体配位的Cr(III)作为CrO6活性较低。用O2或CO2处理使Cr(III)再氧化为Cr(VI)可再生催化剂活性。

</Chinese version answer>


<quotes>

[1] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

[2] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."  

</quotes>

<English version answer>

3. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario where tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI) as CrO4 serves as the active site that dehydrogenates propane to propene, while being reduced to less active octahedrally coordinated Cr(III) as CrO6. The Cr(III) species can then be reoxidized back to active Cr(VI) by O2 or CO2.

</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>

3. 是的,该文提出了一个机理场景,其中四面体配位的Cr(VI)作为CrO4充当活性位点,将丙烷脱氢为丙烯,同时被还原为活性较低的八面体配位的Cr(III),即CrO6。然后Cr(III)物种可以通过O2或CO2被再氧化回活性Cr(VI)。

<quotes>
[1] It has been clarified that the structures of Cr-MCM-41 prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis and template-ion exchange by X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, diffuse reflectance UVvis, X-ray absorption (XANES and EXAFS), and UV-Raman spectroscopic measurements.
[2] Moreover, the two methods resulted in different locations of the accommodated metal cations: highly dispersed metal ions on the wall surface within MCM-41 mesopores for TIE, and monomeric metal species incorporated inside the framework of MCM-41 for DHT.
[3] It was suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromates species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties affects propane dehydrogenation performance over Cr-MCM-41 catalysts. It shows that Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination as monochromates are the active sites, which get reduced to less active Cr(III) species in octahedral coordination as polychromates during reaction. The ability to reoxidize reduced Cr species back to Cr(VI) by oxygen or CO2 is critical for catalyst regeneration. The DHT synthesis method gives more monochromate active sites than TIE method.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文研究了如何调节氧化态、氧的运动性和酸碱性质以影响Cr-MCM-41催化剂上的丙烷脱氢性能。它显示Cr(VI)物种在四面体配位作为单铬酸盐时是活性位点,在反应过程中被还原为八面体配位的较不活跃的Cr(III)物种作为聚铬酸盐。用氧气或CO2将还原的Cr物种重新氧化回Cr(VI)对于催化剂再生至关重要。DHT合成方法产生的单铬酸盐活性位点比TIE方法更多。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%.  
[2] It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction.
[3] It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra.

Answer: Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over the Cr-MCM-41 catalysts. It suggests that tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI) forms an active monochromate species that dehydrogenates propane to propene, while simultaneously getting reduced to less active octahedrally coordinated Cr(III) polychromate species.
