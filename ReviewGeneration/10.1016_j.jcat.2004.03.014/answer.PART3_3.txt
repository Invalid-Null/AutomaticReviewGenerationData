The synthesis gel was stirred for 1 h at room temperature and was then transferred to a Teflon bottle, which was placed in a stainless-steel autoclave after the adjustment of the pH value of the mixed gel to 10.5 with 4 M HCl. The hydrothermal synthesis was carried out at 150 C for 48 h, and then the resultant solid was recovered by filtration, washed thoroughly with deionized water, and dried at 40 C in vacuum for ca. 24 h.

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses direct hydrothermal synthesis and template ion-exchange methods to incorporate the metal species into the MCM-41 framework or disperse them on the surface. These methods resulted in differences in location, coordination environment, and dispersion of the metal species.

Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It reveals oxidation state changes of the chromium species from Cr(VI) to Cr(III) during catalysis, indicating reduction of the active Cr(VI) sites. It also shows that reoxidation treatments using O2 or CO2 can regenerate the active Cr(VI) sites.

<quotes>
The changes in both XANES (Fig. 10A, a and b) and the EXAFS (Fig. 10B, a and b) spectra indicate that the Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra were reduced to an aggregated form of the Cr(III)O6 octahedra during the reaction for 3 h. After the treatment with O2, the XANES (Fig. 10A, c) and the EXAFS spectra (Fig. 10B, c) showed a sharp preedge peak and a single peak, respectively, suggesting that the Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra were regenerated by the reoxidation of the Cr(III)O6 octahedra.
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. As stated in the quote, it shows the reduction of Cr(VI) sites to Cr(III) during reaction, and the reoxidation back to Cr(VI) after oxygen treatment. This demonstrates the crucial redox cycle between Cr(VI) and Cr(III) that enables catalyst regeneration.

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,这篇文章使用X射线吸收光谱来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。正如引文中所述,它显示了Cr(VI)位点在反应过程中被还原为Cr(III),并在氧处理后被氧化回Cr(VI)。这证明了Cr(VI)和Cr(III)之间的关键氧化还原循环,该循环使催化剂再生成为可能。
