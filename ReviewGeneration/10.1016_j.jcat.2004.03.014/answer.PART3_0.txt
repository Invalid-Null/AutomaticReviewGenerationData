[1] "M-MCM-41 catalysts (M: V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Ga) prepared by direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis have been tested for dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide."

[2] "The synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption (77 K), diffuse reflectance UVvis, UV-Raman, and X-ray absorption (XANES and EXAFS) spectroscopic measurements."

[3] "We have carefully studied the structures of Cr-MCM-41 prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis and template-ion exchange by X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, diffuse reflectance UVvis, X-ray absorption (XANES and EXAFS), and UV-Raman spectroscopic measurements"

[4] "The two methods resulted in different locations and coordination environments of the incorporated metal cations, the TIE method provided highly dispersed metal ions on the wall surface of MCM-41 inside the mesopores, and the DHT method has a tendency to incorporate metal ions inside the framework of MCM-41."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE). The TIE method provided highly dispersed metal ions on the wall surface inside the mesopores, while the DHT method incorporated metal ions inside the framework. The materials were characterized by various techniques to study the metal dispersion.

[1] "Cr-MCM-41-DHT showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%." 

[2] "X-ray absorption spectroscopic measurements were performed with Synchrotron radiation at a beam-line BL7C station of the Photon Factory, at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (Tsukuba, Japan)"

[3] "the changes in both XANES (Fig. 10A, a and b) and the EXAFS (Fig. 10B, a and b) spectra indicate that the Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra were reduced to an aggregated form of the Cr(III)O6 octahedra during the reaction for 3 h. After the treatment with O2, the XANES (Fig. 10A, c) and the EXAFS spectra (Fig. 10B, c) showed a sharp preedge peak and a single peak, respectively, suggesting that the Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra were regenerated by the reoxidation of the Cr(III)O6 octahedra."

[4] "Both XANES (Fig. 13A, a, b, and c) and EXAFS (Fig. 13B, a, b, and c) spectra of the sample before the first TPR, after the H2 treatment, and after the treatment with CO2 are shown in Fig. 13."

[1] "according to the Cr-K-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with a Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 8A, ad), a preedge peak was clearly observed before the reaction, while this peak was significantly weakened even after the reaction for 0.5 h and the edge position shifted to lower energy during the reaction, suggesting that the local symmetry around the chromium center has been changed from tetrahedral coordination to octahedral coordination during the reaction"

[2] "In the results of Fourier transforms of k3-weighted Cr-K-edge EXAFS (Fig. 8B, a), a single peak was observed before the reaction and could be assigned to the bond of CrO, consisting of two CrO bonds and two CrO bonds in CrO4 tetrahedra" 

[3] "After the reaction for 0.5 h (Fig. 8B, b), two distinct peaks appeared at 1.6 and 2.6 Å (non-phase-shift corrected) and the intensity of the latter peak increased, while that of the first one decreased, during the reaction (Fig. 8B, c and d)."

[4] "It is suggested that tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI) plays an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2."

Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It utilizes X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS) to study changes in chromium oxidation state and coordination environment in Cr-MCM-41 catalysts during reaction. The data revealed that active Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination are reduced to less active Cr(III) species in octahedral coordination during catalysis.
