To generate the consistency ratios, I compared the English answers from each file to the correct English answers provided. I marked answers as 100% consistent if they conveyed the same information as the correct answer, and 0% consistent if they conveyed contradictory or no relevant information. For partial consistency I would assign an intermediate percentage. But in this case the answers were either fully consistent or contradictory, so I used 100% and 0% ratings accordingly.

I structured the output in the requested XML format with a <question> element for each question number, containing <answer> elements with consistency ratios for each file. The file names were provided in the file attributes as specified. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
