To determine the consistency percentages, I compared the key points and concepts covered in each answer file against the provided correct answer file. The answers matched very closely overall, with most scoring 100% consistency. The one exception is Question 3 for file answer.PART3_4.txt, which had some relevant differences in details compared to the correct answer, so I estimated 80% consistency for that response.
