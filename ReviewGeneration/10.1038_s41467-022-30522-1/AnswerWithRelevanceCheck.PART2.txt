         [1] "For propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a key reaction of great industrial incentives1,2,3,4." 
         [2] "Recently, the subnanometric PtSnOx cluster encapsulated into SiO2 MFI zeolite (PtSnOx@MFI) was shown to be a promising solution to achieve both high activity and low deactivation rate of catalytic PDH reaction7."
         [3] "The catalytic role of zeolite remains elusive due to the difficulty to characterize the active site inside zeolite tunnels."
         [4] "The catalytic kinetics of PDH on representative active sites is therefore clarified. Our results reveal a mortise-and-tenon joinery mechanism for forming confined clusters in zeolite that leads to grow stable clusters within 10 atoms. While two types of structural units, i.e., Sn4O4 cluster with [SnO3] coordinations and PtSn alloys, are both thermodynamically viable in zeolite, only the PtSn clusters with a high Pt:Sn ratio (>1:1) are catalytically active for PDH."

         Yes, the article evaluates PtSn alloy catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on the activity and stability of subnanometric PtSnOx clusters encapsulated in MFI zeolite for propane dehydrogenation. The article finds PtSn clusters with high Pt:Sn ratios (>1:1) are catalytically active, while SnOx clusters are not active.

         [2] "Among, the PtSn clusters with high Pt:Sn ratios (>1:1) are active for propane dehydrogenation to propene, 103 in turnover-of-frequency greater than conventional Pt3Sn metal."  
         [3] "Our results indicate that small PtSn clusters are in fact beneficial for PDH reaction and thus to stabilize and to increase their concentration should be the key goal to achieve. For this purpose, zeolite is unique in offering the geometrical confinement and the weak metal-support interaction."
