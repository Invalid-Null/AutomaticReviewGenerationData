I analyzed each answer file and compared it to the correct answers provided. Since all the answer files indicated that the literature did not contain information relevant to answering the specific questions asked, they are fully consistent with the correct answers, so I put 100% for the consistency ratio for each question-file pair. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on anything!
