1. Propene production from propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a key reaction of great industrial incentives. PDH is an endothermic reaction favored at high temperatures (>723K). 

2. The reaction has to be operated at high temperatures (>723K), which however causes severe problems in catalysis, e.g., the carbon-coking and sintering for industrial alumina-supported PtSn catalysts.

3. The subnanometric PtSnOx cluster encapsulated into SiO2 MFI zeolite (PtSnOx@MFI) was shown to be a promising solution to achieve both high activity and low deactivation rate of catalytic PDH reaction. 

4. Theoretical calculations on Pt3Sn surfaces have shown that the presence of Sn significantly reduces the adsorption of propene relative to pure Pt metal and thus improve the selectivity.

5. The encapsulated PtSn catalysts appear to be PtSnOx clusters in SiO2 MFI zeolite, being distinct from the conventional model of Pt3Sn alloy. This finding renews the search for optimum PtSn structures for PDH.

6. By using machine learning-based global optimization, we manage to rank in energy millions of structural candidates with varied cluster size and compositions and eventually screen out the thermodynamically favored ones. 

7. The functionalities of the two stages in catalyst preparation are now clarified, namely, the oxidative clustering and the reductive transformation, which form separated Sn4O4 and PtSn alloy clusters in MFI.

8. The free energy profile of PDH reaction further confirms the high activity and selectivity for small PtxSny alloy clusters that contain the low-coordinated anionic Pt atoms exposed toward zeolite channels.

1. The article provides background that propene production from propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an important industrial reaction but is limited by issues like coking and sintering. It states that PDH is endothermic and favored at high temperatures above 723K. 

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate PDH by enabling the reaction at lower temperatures, avoiding problems like coking and sintering. It describes how PtSn catalysts in zeolites can achieve this by mechanisms like tuning propene adsorption strength.

3. The article introduces catalysts like metal oxides, supported metals, alloys (e.g. PtSn), and zeolites. It gives the example of Pt3Sn surfaces improving selectivity by modifying propene adsorption relative to pure Pt.

4. The article discusses how PDH is thermodynamically limited but enabled by catalysts kinetically lowering activation barriers. It provides quantitative details of PDH thermodynamics and kinetics.

5. The article describes using DFT calculations to study PDH mechanisms on surfaces like Pt3Sn. Computational insights revealed include how Sn modifies propene adsorption energies.

6. The article does not present microkinetic modeling of PDH.

7. The article describes using global optimization to identify thermodynamically stable PtSn clusters in zeolites. Relationships revealed include how low coordinated Pt is active and Sn modifies activity by donating electrons.
