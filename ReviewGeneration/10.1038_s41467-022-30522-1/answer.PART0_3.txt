[1] Heterogeneous catalysts are often composite materials synthesized via several steps of chemical transformation, and thus the atomic structure in composite is a black-box. 

[2] Broadly speaking, zeolite with ample inner surface sites may better anchor metal clusters and maximize metal exposure without causing carbon-coking and sintering.

2. The article explains that heterogeneous catalysts lower activation energy barriers by providing active sites that can anchor and stabilize reactive intermediates. It states that zeolites in particular can anchor metal clusters and maximize exposure of the metal active sites without causing deactivation through coking and sintering.

[1] Here by using machine learning-based global optimization, we manage to rank in energy millions of structural candidates with varied cluster size and compositions and eventually screen out the thermodynamically favored ones. 

[2] We resolve two critical stages of catalyst preparation, namely, the oxidative clustering and the reductive transformation, and find that only small PtSn alloy and Sn4O4 clusters survive as the major components in MFI due to the mortise-and-tenon joinery mechanism.

[3] The free energy profile of PDH reaction further confirms the high activity and selectivity for small PtxSny alloy clusters that contain the low-coordinated anionic Pt atoms exposed toward zeolite channels.
