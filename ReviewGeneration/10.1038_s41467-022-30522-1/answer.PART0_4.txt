[1] "As favored by entropy, the reaction has to be operated at high temperatures (>723K), which however causes severe problems in catalysis, e.g., the carbon-coking and sintering for industrial alumina-supported PtSn catalysts5,6."  

[2] "The encapsulated PtSn catalysts thus appear to be PtSnOx clusters in SiO2 MFI zeolite, being distinct from the conventional model of Pt3Sn alloy7."

</quotes>

<English version answer> 

2. The article explains that catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering the required operating temperature, which otherwise causes problems like coking and sintering. It notes that encapsulated PtSnOx clusters in MFI zeolite are distinct from conventional Pt3Sn alloy catalysts.

[1] "As favored by entropy, the reaction has to be operated at high temperatures (>723K), which however causes severe problems in catalysis, e.g., the carbon-coking and sintering for industrial alumina-supported PtSn catalysts5,6."

[2] "The Gibbs free energy barrier is 0.33eV and the reaction is exothermic by 0.60eV."

[3] "At 773K, a typical experimental temperature, the TOF of propene production on Pt6Sn2@MFI is 1.1×105s1 at the low H coverage and 8.4×104s1 at the high H coverage, which is about three orders of magnitude larger than that on Pt3Sn surfaces (120 and 690s1 on Pt3Sn (111) and (211) surface)."

[1] "Theoretical calculations on Pt3Sn surfaces have shown that the presence of Sn significantly reduces the adsorption of propene relative to pure Pt metal and thus improve the selectivity15,16."

[2] "Here by using machine learning-based global optimization, we manage to rank in energy millions of structural candidates with varied cluster size and compositions and eventually screen out the thermodynamically favored ones." 

[3] "Then, the catalytic kinetics of PDH on representative active sites is therefore clarified."
