[1] "
For propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a key reaction of great industrial incentives1,2,3,4."
[2] "Recently, the subnanometric PtSnOx cluster encapsulated into SiO2 MFI zeolite (PtSnOx@MFI) was shown to be a promising solution to achieve both high activity and low deactivation rate of catalytic PDH reaction7."
[3] "The catalytic role of zeolite remains elusive due to the difficulty to characterize the active site inside zeolite tunnels."
[4] "The catalytic kinetics of PDH on representative active sites is therefore clarified. Our results reveal a mortise-and-tenon joinery mechanism for forming confined clusters in zeolite that leads to grow stable clusters within 10 atoms. While two types of structural units, i.e., Sn4O4 cluster with [SnO3] coordinations and PtSn alloys, are both thermodynamically viable in zeolite, only the PtSn clusters with a high Pt:Sn ratio (>1:1) are catalytically active for PDH."
