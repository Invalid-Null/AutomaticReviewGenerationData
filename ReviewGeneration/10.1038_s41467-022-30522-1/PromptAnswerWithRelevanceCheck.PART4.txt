 Unfortunately, the given literature does not contain any relevant information to answer the questions asked. The article focuses on discussing the computational modeling and optimization of propane dehydrogenation catalysts using machine learning methods. It does not provide any details regarding process intensification, techno-economic analysis, safety issues, remaining challenges, high-throughput screening, in-situ characterization, or transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation specifically. Since none of the questions can be answered based on the given literature, there are no relevant quotes to extract.

 Unfortunately the literature provided does not contain any relevant information to answer the questions asked. The paper focuses on developing machine learning models to explore potential PtSn alloy catalyst structures for propane dehydrogenation reactions, but does not discuss process intensification approaches, techno-economic factors, safety issues, remaining challenges, high-throughput screening, in-situ characterization, or transformational catalyst architectures for propane dehydrogenation specifically. Since there are no relevant quotes from the literature, I will summarize that none of the questions can be adequately answered based on the given information.
