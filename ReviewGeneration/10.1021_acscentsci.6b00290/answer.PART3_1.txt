[1] "We selected NU-1000, a MOF composed of Zr6(μ3-O)4(μ3-OH)4(H2O)4(OH)4 nodes and tetratopic 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(p-benzoate)pyrene (TBAPy4) linkers, as our catalytic platform (27) (Figure 1) due to its previously observed behavior as a near-ideal support for Ir- and Ni-based gas-phase catalysts."

[2] "In our current work, we targeted cobalt as the deposited metal ions on NU-1000 since nanosized spinel Co3O4 have been shown to catalyze the propane ODH process under gentle reaction conditions."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates two catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion - solvothermal deposition in a MOF (SIM) and atomic layer deposition in a MOF (AIM). Cobalt ions are deposited onto the MOF NU-1000 using these techniques.

[1] "Upon activation in a flow of O2 at 230 C, both materials catalyze the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propene under mild conditions." 

[2] "By using a few low-order, intense, and nonoverlapping reflections from the powder X-ray pattern, a surface (surface envelope) dividing the regions with high and low electron densities can be produced."

[3] "We used in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy to probe the valence and structural information on the deposited Co ions in these two materials."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ characterization techniques, specifically in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, to study the working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. This technique provided information on the valence and structure of the deposited cobalt ions during catalysis.
</English version answer>

<English version answer>
Answer: No, the article does not employ advanced microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It focuses on other characterization methods like X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 
答:不,这篇文章没有采用先进的显微技术来表征丙烷脱氢催化剂中的金属-支持体界面。它关注于其他表征方法,如X射线衍射和X射线吸收光谱。

<quotes>
[1] "The pre-edge feature at 7709.2 eV (1s → 3d) in the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES, Figure S12) spectra indicates that the deposited Co ions in both as-synthesized materials remain in the +2 oxidation state, the same as the used Co precursors."

[2] "Upon activation in O2 at 230 C for 4 h, there is a slight increase in the intensity of the pre-edge peak together with a decrease in the white-line intensity at 7724 eV, indicating the formation of Co(III) species."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. The technique revealed that the cobalt ions started in the +2 oxidation state, and then formed Co(III) species during activation in O2.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,这篇文章使用X射线吸收光谱来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。该技术揭示钴离子起初处于+2氧化态,然后在O2激活过程中形成Co(III)物种。
