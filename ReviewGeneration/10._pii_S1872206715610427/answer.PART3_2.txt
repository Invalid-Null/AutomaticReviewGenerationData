[1] "A CrOx/SiO2 catalyst containing 6% (by mass) Cr was prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation of SiO2 with an aqueous chromium nitrate solution."

[2] "In other trials, ethanol (99 wt.%) was used instead of deionized water as the solvent to prepare the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst."

[3] "Prior to the dehydrogenation reaction trials, the catalysts were both pretreated at 353 K under saturated ethanol vapor carried in a 20-mL/min He flow for 1 h."

[1] "TEM observations were conducted using a JEM-2100 instrument with a 200-kV accelerating voltage. Samples were first dispersed in ethanol in an ultrasonic bath, after which a drop of the suspension was deposited on a carbon-coated copper TEM grid." 

[2] "The TEM images of the three samples shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate that the samples contained uniformly dispersed rod-like clusters."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article employs transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize metal-support interfaces and dispersion in the CrOx/SiO2 propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It provides images showing uniformly dispersed rod-like CrOx clusters on the SiO2 support.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer> 
答:是的,该文采用了透射电子显微镜(TEM)来表征CrOx/SiO2丙烷脱氢催化剂中的金属-支撑体界面和分散性。它提供了均匀分散的杆状CrOx聚集物在SiO2支撑体上的图像。

[1] "Fig. 4 displays the XPS data obtained for the CrH and CrH-Et. Curve fitting of the Cr 2p1/2 line data determined the presence of Cr6+ and Cr3+ in these samples, at binding energies of approximately 588 and 586 eV, respectively."

[2] "Compared with the CrH spectrum, the intensities of the CrH-Et peaks were decreased owing to the reduction of Cr by the ethanol vapor." 

[3] "In the case of the CrH catalyst, the Cr6+/Cr3+ peak intensity ratio decreased from 0.35 to 0.23 after pretreatment with the ethanol vapor (Table 2), thus the Cr6+ species were evidently converted to Cr3+."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to probe oxidation state changes of Cr species during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows that ethanol vapor pretreatment reduces Cr6+ to Cr3+ by analyzing changes in the Cr 2p peaks and Cr6+/Cr3+ intensity ratios.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文使用了X射线光电子能谱(XPS)来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中Cr物种的氧化态变化。它通过分析Cr 2p峰和Cr6+/Cr3+强度比的变化,表明乙醇蒸气预处理将Cr6+还原为Cr3+。
