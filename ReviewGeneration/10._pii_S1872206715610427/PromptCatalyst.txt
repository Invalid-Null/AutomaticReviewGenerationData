The effect of ethanol on the performance of CrOx/SiO2 catalysts during propane dehydrogenation

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1872206715610427

AbstractAbstract
The effects of ethanol vapor pretreatment on the performance of CrOx/SiO2 catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene were studied with and without the presence of CO2. The catalyst pretreated with ethanol vapor exhibited better catalytic activity than the pristine CrOx/SiO2, generating 41.4% propane conversion and 84.8% propylene selectivity. The various catalyst samples prepared were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy. The data show that coordinative Cr3+ species represent the active sites during the dehydrogenation of propane and that these species serve as precursors for the generation of Cr3+. Cr3+ is reduced during the reaction, leading to a decrease in catalytic activity. Following ethanol vapor pretreatment, the reduced CrOx in the catalyst is readily re-oxidized to Cr6+ by CO2. The pretreated catalyst thus exhibits high activity during the propane dehydrogenation reaction by maintaining the active Cr3+ states.
Graphical Abstract
The coordinated Cr6+ was reduced to lower oxidation state of Cr by the ethanol vapor pretreatment, Cr3+ and Cr2+ of CrH-Et was easily regenerated to Cr6+ by CO2 comparing with CrH, indicating that higher concentration of Cr6+ existed on CrH during the dehydrogenation reaction.

1. Introduction
Propylene is an important intermediate in the production of polymers and other chemical compounds that are widely used in petrochemical and polymer-based processes [1, 2, 3, 4]. At present, the majority of propylene is obtained by conventional cracking reactions, such as steam cracking, which has one of the highest energy demands in chemical industry, and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC), from which propylene is generated as a byproduct. Increasing demand for propylene has led to a growing interest in the development of new processes for its production, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction is an attractive alternative to conventional propylene production processes [5, 6, 7]. However, the use of oxygen as the oxidant in this method can easily promote over-oxidation, resulting in a significant decrease in selectivity for propylene.
The use of carbon dioxide (CO2), a milder oxidant, can mitigate this problem and so this approach has been employed in some cases [8, 9]. The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been recently studied as an alternative to the conventional processes [10, 11]. These studies have applied many different bulk and supported materials, including Cr [12, 13], V [14, 15], Mo [16], Ga [17], Zn [18], Mn [19] and Mg [20], as catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. It has been determined that the propylene yields obtained through this method are higher than those obtained using commercial dehydrogenation processes [21, 22, 23, 24]. These investigations have demonstrated that CO2 improves the yield of propylene through two mechanisms. First, CO2 can function as an oxidizing agent in the following redox cycle.

Second, CO2 can play a role in the consumption of H2 produced from the dehydrogenation of propane (3) via the reverse water-gas shift reaction (4).

Chromium oxide-based catalysts are considered promising catalysts for the ODH reaction when using CO2 because these materials tend to be the most active among metal oxides. There has been significant research into the active sites on CrOx/SiO2 catalysts since Frey and Huppke first reported their excellent activity for the dehydrogenation of propane [25]. Their work has shown that the catalytic activity of SiO2-supported CrOx is influenced by several factors: oxidation states, the structure of Cr species and the interaction between Cr and SiO2. The state of the active Cr species is especially important during the dehydrogenation process because the propane molecules first adsorb on Cr-O sites as a prelude to a series of reactions. Studies have demonstrated the simultaneous presence of a variety of Cr species in the catalysts, including isolated, dimer, trimer and polymeric, with different nuclearities, as well as large Cr2O3 clusters with varying oxidation and coordination states. Tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ is considered to be an active species and can be reduced to octahedrally coordinated Cr3+, which is less active during the ODH reaction [11, 26]. In contrast, coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ has also been proposed as an active site based on in situ spectroscopy analyses [27, 28, 29]. It has been directly observed that Cr3+ species are produced at the expense of Cr6+ species during the initial stage of the ODH reaction. However, Cr6+ has not been found to be active in this reaction, and is instead considered as a precursor to the formation of active Cr3+ sites.
It is well known that many factors, such as the metal precursor, the solvent, the aging time/temperature and the calcination temperature, can affect the catalytic performance when the catalysts are prepared by an impregnation method. For example, the solvents used to synthesize Pt precursors can significantly influence the interactions between Pt species and SiO2 supports [30]. In addition, the mechanochemical [31, 32] or pre-reduction [33, 34] treatments of the catalysts play an important role in the dispersion of metals on the supports. Li's group [33] reported that catalytic performance was greatly affected by pre-reduction of catalysts, because this consumed surface-adsorbed oxygen species and generated Fe and Fe2+, both of which were active for propane dehydrogenation.
In the present work, the performance of a CrOx/SiO2 catalyst pretreated with ethanol vapor was studied during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. The pretreated catalyst exhibited better activity than the initial CrOx/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2. The effect of ethanol pretreatment on the various Cr species was assessed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that the ethanol-pretreated catalyst is readily re-oxidized by CO2 during the ODH reaction and that more active sites (octahedrally coordinated Cr3+) were maintained in the as-prepared catalyst.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Commercially available SiO2 (specific surface area 453 m2/g) was used as the support in this study. A CrOx/SiO2 catalyst containing 6% (by mass) Cr was prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation of SiO2 with an aqueous chromium nitrate solution. After impregnation, each sample was dried at 393 K for 12 h and then was calcined at 873 K for another 2 h. In other trials, ethanol (99 wt.%) was used instead of deionized water as the solvent to prepare the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst. These two materials (synthesized with either deionized water or dehydrated ethanol) were employed in this work as the impregnated solvents and are denoted as CrH and CrE, respectively.
Prior to the dehydrogenation reaction trials, the catalysts were both pretreated at 353 K under saturated ethanol vapor carried in a 20-mL/min He flow for 1 h. The resulting catalysts are denoted as CrH-Et and CrE-Et, respectively.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The BET surface areas and pore volumes of catalysts were obtained by N2 physisorption at 77 K using an ASAP2020 instrument (Micromeritics Corporation, USA). The samples were degassed at 553 K for 3 h prior to these measurements. The Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) method was employed to calculate the specific surface areas (SBET) over the relative pressure range of 0.05 <p/p0 < 0.3, as well as the total pore volume (Vtotal) at p/p0 = 0.98.
TEM observations were conducted using a JEM-2100 instrument with a 200-kV accelerating voltage. Samples were first dispersed in ethanol in an ultrasonic bath, after which a drop of the suspension was deposited on a carbon-coated copper TEM grid. The extent of metal dispersion and the average particle size were determined from measurements of over 200 particles from various regions over the observed sample.
XRD patterns were recorded using a Bruker D2 Phaser instrument. The diffraction patterns were collected with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at a scanning rate of 0.013°/s.
The reducibility and regenerating ability of each of the catalysts were investigated based on a three-step H2-TPR analysis with O2 and CO2. In a typical TPR trial, approximately 200 mg of the sample was transferred to a U-tube reactor and heated under He (30 mL/min) from room temperature to 623 K for 1 h. After cooling the sample to 383 K, the gas was switched to 10% H2/90% He (30 mL/min) and the temperature was increased from 383 to 973 K at 10 K/min. In order to make sure all Cr species were fully reduced, the above TPR process was subsequently repeated. Finally, the sample was cooled and treated with either O2 or CO2 gas (30 mL/min) at 873 K for 1 h. After this exposure, the sample was again processed using the same TPR conditions detailed above.
XPS pattern were acquired using a VG ESCALAB MK2 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with Al Kα radiation (hv = 1486.6 eV). The X-ray anode was operated at 250 W and the voltage was maintained at 12.5 kV with a detection angle of 90°. The pass energy was fixed at 50 eV to allow the acquisition of high resolution spectra and the base pressure in the analysis chamber was 2 × 10−8 Pa. Both survey and multi-region spectra were recorded for the C 1s, Si 1s and Cr 2p photoelectron peaks. The Peak XPS 4.1 software package was used to fit the high resolution spectra.
Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra were obtained with a Varian Cary spectrophotometer. The spectra were collected over the range 200–700 nm, using BaSO4 as a reference material.
2.3. Catalytic tests
Experimental trials were performed in a quartz fixed-bed reactor packed with approximately 200 mg of the catalyst at 873 K under atmospheric pressure. The feed gas was composed of C3H8 and CO2 with He as the carrier (total flow rate = 20 mL/min). Prior to the dehydrogenation reaction, the catalyst was pretreated with saturated ethanol vapor in He flow 20 mL/min at 353 K for 1 h. Following this, the reaction chamber was purged with He for a further 0.5 h after which the sample temperature was ramped to the reaction temperature at 5 K/min. All products were analyzed on-line with an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph (GC). Propane conversion (X) and propylene selectivity (S) expressed as mol on a C atom basis, were defined as in the following equations.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the catalysts
Table 1 summarizes the surface area and pore volume values of the samples. The surface area of the CrH was 441 m2/g, and the surface area of the pretreated catalyst CrH-Et was similar, indicating that ethanol pretreatment did not disturb the construction of the catalyst. However, following their use in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, the surface area and pore volume of the CrH significantly decreased, to 200 m2/g and 0.30 cm3/g, while the surface area and pore volume of the CrH-Et only slightly decreased, from 413 m2/g and 0.58 cm3/g to 389 m2/g and 0.57 cm3/g, respectively. It is well known that a larger surface area and greater pore volume are beneficial with regard to mass transport and reaction heat removal, as well as avoiding hot spots during catalytic reactions. It was interesting to observe that the ethanol pretreatment evidently prevented carbon deposition over the catalysts, which can result in the blockage of channels during the dehydrogenation reaction.

As shown in Fig. 1, only weak α-Cr2O3 diffraction peaks were observed for all samples. It has been demonstrated that a Cr coverage that exceeds a monolayer thickness leads to the formation of both amorphous and crystalline α-Cr2O3 [35]. Crystalline α-Cr2O3 is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase and has a negative influence on the catalytic activity. Other chromium species were not identifiable in the patterns, indicating that, if present, these species were highly dispersed over the SiO2 support.

The TEM images of the three samples shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate that the samples contained uniformly dispersed rod-like clusters. The size distributions of these clusters are also summarized in Fig. 2. The CrE had a narrow distribution, with an average size of approximately 90 nm. The distribution of clusters for the CrH-Et was similar, but with an average size of 115 nm. In contrast, the TEM image of the CrH distinctly shows the presence of both large and small clusters. The cluster size distribution of the CrH was quite wide, although the widths of the clusters in the untreated CrH were smaller than those in the CrH-Et and CrE.

Fig. 3 summarizes the reducing and regenerating abilitie of the CrH and CrH-Et samples. In Fig. 3(a), the main reduction peak appears between 600 and 800 K. This peak is assigned to the reduction of coordinative Cr6+ to lower oxidation state Cr species (Cr3+ and Cr2+) on the SiO2 materials [27]. Another reduction peak between 480 and 560 K is also observed. The location of this peak coincides with the low temperature reduction of bulk α-Cr2O3, and thus is assigned to the reduction of Cr6+ species dispersed on α-Cr2O3 to Cr3+ [36]. These results are in agreement with the XRD analysis, in which a weak α-Cr2O3 diffraction peak was generated by the CrH and CrH-Et samples. Furthermore, the reduction peak area of the CrH-Et is much smaller than that of the CrH, suggesting that the CrH-Et was reduced by the ethanol vapor pretreatment and that the amount of Cr6+ on the CrH-Et was much less than that on the CrH. In the second TPR run, a negligible reduction peak is evident, indicating that all Cr states were completely reduced in the first TPR step. After treatment with O2, most of Cr6+ was recovered, as shown in the third TPR-O2 run data in Fig. 3(b). However, the coordinative Cr6+ reduction peak area of the CrH-Et was larger than that of the CrH; this indicates that the regenerating ability of the coordinative Cr6+ on the CrH-Et was greater than that on the CrH and that more coordinative Cr6+ was present on the pretreated CrH-Et during the ODH reaction. The extent of polymeric Cr6+ reduction on bulk α-Cr2O3 over the CrH-Et was less than that on the CrH, demonstrating that the regeneration of polymeric Cr6+ was suppressed following pretreatment with ethanol. After exposure to CO2, little coordinative Cr6+ was recovered by soft oxidation with CO2 (Fig. 3(c)). Furthermore, the reduction peak area of the coordinative Cr6+ on the CrH-Et was larger than that obtained from the CrH, providing evidence that greater quantities of Cr3+ and Cr2+ species were reoxidized to Cr6+ upon treatment with CO2 in the case of the CrH-Et.

Fig. 4 displays the XPS data obtained for the CrH and CrH-Et. Curve fitting of the Cr 2p1/2 line data determined the presence of Cr6+ and Cr3+ in these samples, at binding energie of approximately 588 and 586 eV, respectively. Compared with the CrH spectrum, the intensitie of the CrH-Et peaks were decreased owing to the reduction of Cr by the ethanol vapor. In the case of the CrH catalyst, the Cr6+/Cr3+ peak intensity ratio decreased from 0.35 to 0.23 after pretreatment with the ethanol vapor (Table 2), thus the Cr6+ species were evidently converted to Cr3+. The previous TPR data showed that the coordinative Cr6+ was reduced to lower oxidation states (Cr3+ or Cr2+), which is in agreement with these XPS results.

The UV-Vis spectra of the CrH and CrH-Et before and after the reaction are shown in Fig. 5. An intense band around 270 nm with a shoulder at 360 nm and weak bands at approximate 470 and 600 nm were observed for all the samples. The peaks at 270 and 360 nm can be assigned to charge transfer from O2– to tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ as the result of the transfer transitions 1A1 → 1T2 (1t1 → 7t2 and 6t2 → 2e) and 1A1 → 1T2 (1t1 → 2e), respectively [37]. Prior to the dehydrogenation step of the propane reaction, the intensity of the 360-nm peak declined following ethanol vapor pretreatment, indicating a decrease in the concentration of tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+. Furthermore, after the reaction, the intensity of this band increased as compared with that of the CrH, suggesting that low oxidation state Cr was easier to regenerate using CO2 than the CrH during the reaction, which had already been demonstrated by the three-step TPR analysis.

The additional band at 470 nm is typically assigned to dichromates, while the weak band at 600 nm is attributed to the d-d transition of Cr3+ (A2g → T2g) in octahedrally symmetric Cr2O3, indicating the formation of crystalline Cr2O3. This result was in accordance with the XRD analysis showing Cr2O3 patterns (Fig. 1).
3.2. Catalytic performance in the propane dehydrogenation reaction
Studies on the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene were conducted under different reaction conditions with the CrH and CrH-Et catalysts. The exit gases were found to consist of propane, propylene, methane, ethane, ethene and He. To study the effects of ethanol pretreatment, a CrE catalyst was prepared for comparison, and the results obtained from all samples are shown in Fig. 6. Under the same reaction conditions, the propane conversion over the CrH-Et catalyst was much higher than that over the CrE or CrE-Et, while the conversion over the CrE was lower than that over the CrH. Furthermore, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity of the CrE-Et was slightly higher than those of the untreated CrE, indicating that the ethanol vapor had a beneficial effect on the CrE catalyst, but that ethanol was not suitable for use as an impregnation solvent. The deactivation tendencies of the CrH and CrH-Et were significantly lower than those of the CrE and CrE-Et. The cluster sizes of these catalysts were previously analyzed by TEM (Fig. 2), and the average cluster size of the CrE was smaller than that of the CrH and CrH-Et, while the distribution of clusters in the CrH-Et was similar with that in the CrE. However, the catalytic activity of the CrE was much lower than that of the CrH-Et, indicating that the catalyst cluster size did not play an important role in the catalytic activity during dehydrogenation.

Fig. 7 presents the catalytic properties of the CrH and CrH-Et samples during the dehydrogenation of propane without CO2. The initial activity decreased sharply under these reaction conditions, and the activity of the CrH-Et was evidently slightly higher than that of untreated catalyst CrH. The coordinative Cr6+ species on the CrH-Et catalyst were reduced by the ethanol pretreatment, as was demonstrated by the first run TPR data (Fig. 3(a)) and confirmed by XPS (Fig. 4) and UV-Vis (Fig. 5) analyses. These characterization results clearly show that the coordinated Cr6+ species were not the active sites in this reaction process. After the dehydrogenation of propane, there was a higher concentration of Cr6+ species in the CrH-Et compared with that in the untreated CrH, suggesting that the catalytic activity was related to the Cr6+. The coordinative Cr6+ species thus served as precursors for the Cr3+ active sites, a phenomenon that has previously been reported [27, 38, 39].

To clarify the contribution of CO2 to the reaction, the effects of the partial pressure of CO2 were investigated over the CrH and CrH-Et samples, with the results shown in Table 3. Variation in the CO2 pressure had a significant impact on the catalysts' performance during propane dehydrogenation. The propane conversion substantially increased with increases in the CO2 pressure in the case of the CrH and also decreased the selectivity for propylene. However, the propane conversion over the CrH-Et increased to a maximum 41.4% and then decreased as the CO2 pressure increased. Two possibilities have been proposed to explain the promotional effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. It may be that CO2 acts as an oxidant to reduce carbon deposition during the dehydrogenation reaction and/or it may reduce the H2 produced from the dehydrogenation reaction via the water-gas shift reaction.

1:5:4 28.0 41.4 85.9 84.8
1:9:0 32.9 38.5 82.1 83.2
Reaction conditions: T = 873 K, total flow = 20 mL/min, catalyst mass 200 mg.
Employing a C3H8:CO2:He ratio of 1:3:6 remarkably increased the propane conversion, from 24.7% to 34.5%, after ethanol vapor pretreatment. Changing this ratio to 1:5:4, the initial activity of the CrH-Et was 41.4% with 84.8% propylene selectivity, values are higher than those obtained from the CrH (28.0% propane conversion with 85.9% propylene selectivity). It is therefore clear that the ethanol vapor pretreatment contributed to the promotional activation of the CrH-Et. The three-step TPR data also revealed that the coordinative Cr6+ species were reduced, and that Cr3+ and Cr2+ were easily re-oxidized to Cr6+ in the presence of CO2. These processes account for the high conversion observed under CO2.
By combining the results of the three-step H2-TPR, XPS and UV-vis analyses, we can propose that the coordinated Cr6+ was reduced to lower oxidation states by the ethanol vapor pretreatment. In addition, the Cr3+ and Cr2+ in the CrH-Et were readily regenerated to Cr6+ in the presence of CO2 as compared with the species on the CrH; therefore, higher concentrations of Cr6+ were present on the CrH after the dehydrogenation reaction. On this basis, we suggest a mechanism for the ODH reaction with CrH-Et, as shown in Scheme 1. Here the Cr6+ states in CrOx that act as active site precursors, are reduced to Cr3+ by the ethanol. The coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ states work to promote the dehydrogenation reaction, after which the active Cr3+ species are reduced to Cr2+ species by the H2 generated during the reaction, deactivating the catalyst. The soft oxidant CO2 generates O*ads to re-oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ and Cr3+ to Cr6+, with the result that more active centers are maintained in the pretreated catalyst. Without ethanol pretreatment, the Cr6+ states in the CrOx are immediately reduced to Cr3+ by interaction with propane, and the inactive Cr and Cr2+ are more difficult to re-oxidize during the dehydrogenation reaction. Consequently, the CrH-Et catalyst exhibits high stability in the propane ODH reaction by maintaining the active Cr3+ states.

4. Conclusions
The effects of ethanol on the performance of CrOx/SiO2 catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene were studied with and without the presence of CO2. Without CO2, the activity of the CrH-Et was slightly higher than that of untreated CrH. However, pretreatment with ethanol vapor resulted in dramatically improved propane conversion in the presence of CO2. When the ratio of C3H8:CO2:He was 1:5:4, the optimal result (84.8% propylene selectivity with an overall propane conversion of 41.4%) was achieved after pretreatment with ethanol vapor at 353 K for 1 h. These values are much higher than those obtained from the CrH (28.0% propane conversion with 85.9% propylene selectivity). It was also determined that the use of ethanol as the impregnation solvent (as in the case of the CrE) did not promote the catalytic activity.
The XRD and TEM results suggested that the surface Cr species were highly dispersed on the SiO2 and that the size of the catalyst clusters did not influence the catalytic activity during dehydrogenation. The H2-TPR, XPS and UV-Vis data demonstrated that coordinated Cr6+ was reduced by the ethanol vapor pretreatment and that the reduced Cr species on the CrH-Et were readily reoxidized to Cr6+ in the presence of CO2. The state of the Cr species and the addition of CO2 thus played important roles in the catalytic activity. The Cr6+ species in CrOx, which acted as active site precursors, were reduced to Cr3+ by the ethanol vapor pretreatment. We believe that the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ states functioned as the active sites for the dehydrogenation process, but were reduced to Cr and Cr2+ by H2 generated during the reaction, thus deactivating the as-prepared catalyst. The inactive Cr and Cr2+ in the pretreated catalysts were both easily reoxidized by CO2 during the reaction. Therefore, many active Cr3+ were present, resulting in high activity.
