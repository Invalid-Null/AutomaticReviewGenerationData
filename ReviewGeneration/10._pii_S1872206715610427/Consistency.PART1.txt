I carefully compared the answers provided in each file to the correct answers to determine the consistency percentages. For questions where the file provided no relevant information, I assigned 0% consistency. For questions where the file fully matched the correct answer, I assigned 100% consistency. And for question 3 where file PART1_2.txt partially addressed the prompt, I assigned 50% consistency. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the analysis.
