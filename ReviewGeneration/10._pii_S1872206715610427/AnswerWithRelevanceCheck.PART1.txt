         [1] "We believe that the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ states functioned as the active sites for the dehydrogenation process, but were reduced to Cr and Cr2+ by H2 generated during the reaction, thus deactivating the as-prepared catalyst."

      <English>
         The article proposes that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. These Cr3+ sites are reduced to inactive Cr and Cr2+ by the H2 generated during dehydrogenation, deactivating the catalyst.
      </English>
      <Chinese>
         文献提出配位不饱和的Cr3+物种是丙烷脱氢的活性中心。这些Cr3+位点在脱氢过程中被生成的H2还原成不活性的Cr和Cr2+,使催化剂失活。
