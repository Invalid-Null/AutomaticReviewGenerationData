<quotes>
[1] "We believe that the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ states functioned as the active sites for the dehydrogenation process, but were reduced to Cr and Cr2+ by H2 generated during the reaction, thus deactivating the as-prepared catalyst."

[2] "The inactive Cr and Cr2+ in the pretreated catalysts were both easily reoxidized by CO2 during the reaction."

[3] "Therefore, many active Cr3+ were present, resulting in high activity."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article proposes that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ sites are the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. These Cr3+ sites can be deactivated by being reduced to Cr2+ and Cr by H2 generated during the reaction. CO2 can reoxidize the inactive Cr and Cr2+ species back to active Cr3+ sites.

<Chinese version answer>
答:这篇文章提出,配位不饱和的Cr3+位是丙烷脱氢反应的活性位点。这些Cr3+位点可以被反应生成的H2还原为Cr2+和Cr而失活。CO2可以将非活性Cr和Cr2+种氧化回活性Cr3+位点。
