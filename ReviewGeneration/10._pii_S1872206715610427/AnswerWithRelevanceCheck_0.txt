      [1] "A CrOx/SiO2 catalyst containing 6% (by mass) Cr was prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation of SiO2 with an aqueous chromium nitrate solution." 
      [2] "In other trials, ethanol (99 wt.%) was used instead of deionized water as the solvent to prepare the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst."
      [3] "Prior to the dehydrogenation reaction trials, the catalysts were both pretreated at 353 K under saturated ethanol vapor carried in a 20-mL/min He flow for 1 h."
      [4] "It was interesting to observe that the ethanol pretreatment evidently prevented carbon deposition over the catalysts, which can result in the blockage of channels during the dehydrogenation reaction."

      Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It studies the effect of using ethanol versus water as the solvent during incipient wetness impregnation of chromium oxide on silica. It also evaluates an ethanol vapor pretreatment step and shows it prevents coke deposition.

      [1] "The reducing and regenerating abilities of the CrH and CrH-Et samples. In Fig. 3(a), the main reduction peak appears between 600 and 800 K. This peak is assigned to the reduction of coordinative Cr6+ to lower oxidation state Cr species (Cr3+ and Cr2+) on the SiO2 materials [27]."
      [2] "Fig. 4 displays the XPS data obtained for the CrH and CrH-Et. Curve fitting of the Cr 2p1/2 line data determined the presence of Cr6+ and Cr3+ in these samples, at binding energies of approximately 588 and 586 eV, respectively."  
      [3] "The UV-Vis spectra of the CrH and CrH-Et before and after the reaction are shown in Fig. 5. An intense band around 270 nm with a shoulder at 360 nm and weak bands at approximate 470 and 600 nm were observed for all the samples."
