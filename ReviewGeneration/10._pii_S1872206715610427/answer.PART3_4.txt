[1] "The XRD and TEM results suggested that the surface Cr species were highly dispersed on the SiO2 and that the size of the catalyst clusters did not influence the catalytic activity during dehydrogenation."

[2] "Fig. 4 displays the XPS data obtained for the CrH and CrH-Et. Curve fitting of the Cr 2p1/2 line data determined the presence of Cr6+ and Cr3+ in these samples, at binding energies of approximately 588 and 586 eV, respectively." 

[3] "Compared with the CrH spectrum, the intensities of the CrH-Et peaks were decreased owing to the reduction of Cr by the ethanol vapor."

[4] "In the case of the CrH catalyst, the Cr6+/Cr3+ peak intensity ratio decreased from 0.35 to 0.23 after pretreatment with the ethanol vapor (Table 2), thus the Cr6+ species were evidently converted to Cr3+."

Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques like XRD and XPS to probe oxidation state changes of Cr species during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. XPS in particular is used to quantify changes in Cr6+/Cr3+ ratios after ethanol pretreatment, showing a decrease in Cr6+ relative to Cr3+. This demonstrates the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ by ethanol pretreatment.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文使用了X射线基于技术,如XRD和XPS,来探究丙烷脱氢催化过程中Cr物种的氧化态变化。特别是用XPS技术量化了乙醇预处理后Cr6+/Cr3+比率的变化,结果显示Cr6+相对于Cr3+的含量降低。这表明乙醇预处理使Cr6+被还原为Cr3+。
