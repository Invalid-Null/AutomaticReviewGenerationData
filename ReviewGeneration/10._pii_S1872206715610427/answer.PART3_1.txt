[1] "A CrOx/SiO2 catalyst containing 6% (by mass) Cr was prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation of SiO2 with an aqueous chromium nitrate solution."

[2] "In other trials, ethanol (99 wt.%) was used instead of deionized water as the solvent to prepare the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst."

[3] "Prior to the dehydrogenation reaction trials, the catalysts were both pretreated at 353 K under saturated ethanol vapor carried in a 20-mL/min He flow for 1 h."
