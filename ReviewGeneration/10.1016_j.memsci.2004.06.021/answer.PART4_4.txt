1. The article does not discuss process intensification approaches that can be applied to propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on hydrogen separation membrane technology and does not mention propane dehydrogenation.

2. The article does not analyze techno-economic factors affecting the viability of propane dehydrogenation processes. It is solely focused on hydrogen membrane separation.

3. The article does not discuss safety issues like flammability and explosion hazards associated with propane dehydrogenation. Again, it only covers hydrogen membrane separation.  

4. The article does not summarize remaining challenges and knowledge gaps in propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It is not related to propane dehydrogenation catalysis.

5. The article does not propose leveraging high-throughput computational methods to accelerate propane dehydrogenation catalyst screening and design. It focuses on experimental hydrogen membrane fabrication and testing.  

6. The article does not highlight needs for improved in-situ characterization tools to better understand propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It is unrelated to propane dehydrogenation catalyst characterization.

7. The article does not envision potentially transformational catalyst architectures that could enable performance breakthroughs in propane dehydrogenation. It focuses only on hydrogen separation membrane technology.
