Based on my review, the provided answers do not contain information relevant to the set of questions asked about propane dehydrogenation and propylene production. The answers indicate the literature is about hydrogen separation membranes and does not discuss propane dehydrogenation mechanisms, catalysts, kinetics, computations, or structure-activity relationships. Therefore, I have stopped the review process and responded with the sentence indicating the answers are not relevant, per the instructions.
