[1] "Various amounts of Fe (0.05, 0.14, 0.43, 0.72, and 1.0 wt%) and the fixed amount of Pt (0.5 wt%) were sequentially introduced onto the S-1 support via the charge enhanced dry impregnation method."

[2] "With the knowledge from in situ characterization and density functional theory calculations, recent evidence has shown that the improved olefin selectivity and rates of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are usually attributed to the geometric and electronic effects."

[3] "Therefore, we next focused on studying Pt1Fe7/S-1 with the highest stability."

3. Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It evaluates PtFe bimetallic catalysts supported on silicalite-1 prepared by impregnation with different Pt/Fe ratios. The optimal ratio is found to be Pt1Fe7 for highest stability. Geometric and electronic effects from the bimetallic structure are noted to improve selectivity and activity.

[1] "The HR-TEM images are shown in Figure 7, and the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings of Pt and Fe are displayed in Figure S8." 

[2] "Uniform zeolite particles with a diameter of about 160 nm were observed in the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1 after PDH, with a large amount of amorphous carbon species. On the contrary, the amorphous carbon species was hardly observed in the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1 after CO2-PDH."

[3] "The element distributions of Pt and Fe are uniform according to the EDS mapping results."

[4] "A lattice spacing of 2.23 Å was observed for the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1, suggesting the presence of the Pt3Fe1 alloy phase (PDF# 89-2050) after both PDH and CO2-PDH."

5. Answer: The article employs high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping to characterize metal-support interfaces and morphology in the spent propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Uniform 160 nm zeolite particles are observed. EDS shows uniform Pt and Fe distribution. Lattice spacing indicates presence of Pt3Fe alloy phase after reaction. More amorphous carbon is seen after standard PDH compared to CO2-PDH.

5. 答:本文采用高分辨率透射电子显微镜(HR-TEM)和能量散射X射线光谱(EDS)元素映射来表征金属支持体界面和反应后丙烷脱氢催化剂的形态。观察到均匀的160纳米沸石颗粒。EDS显示Pt和Fe均匀分布。晶格间距显示反应后存在Pt3Fe合金相。与标准PDH相比,CO2-PDH后观察到更多无定形碳。

[1] "The X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements for spent catalysts were conducted on the bending magnet beamline of the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team at the advanced photon source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory, at the Pt LIII edge (11,564 eV) and the Fe K edge (7112 eV)."

[2] "In the Pt 4f7/2 region, the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalysts after PDH and CO2-PDH both show the peak located at 71.3 eV in Figure 4B, which is assigned to metallic Pt (PtFe alloy) species." 

[3] "The ex situ Fe K edge XANES (Figure 6A) spectrum of the Pt1Fe7/S-1 after the PDH reaction lies between Fe(0) foil and Fe3O4, indicating the presence of both Fe(0) and oxidized Fe species due to the exposure to air."

[4] "The iron species of Pt1Fe7/S-1 after the CO2-PDH reaction has obviously higher edge energy and white line intensity, similar to those of Fe3O4."

<English version answer>
6. Answer: The article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Pt LIII and Fe K edges to probe oxidation state changes in the spent propane dehydrogenation catalysts. XAS shows that after standard PDH, both Fe(0) and oxidized Fe species are present. After CO2-PDH, the Fe is predominantly oxidized to Fe3O4. In both cases, Pt remains as metallic Pt in the PtFe alloy. 
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
6. 答:本文使用X射线吸收光谱(XAS)在Pt LIII边和Fe K边检测反应后丙烷脱氢催化剂的氧化态变化。XAS显示,在标准PDH后,Fe(0)和氧化态Fe物种均存在。在CO2-PDH后,Fe主要氧化为Fe3O4。在两种情况下,Pt均维持PtFe合金中的金属Pt形式。
