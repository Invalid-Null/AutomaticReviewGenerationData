[1] "Fine tuning the structure of bimetallic nanoparticles is critical toward understanding structureactivity relationships and further improving the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."

[2] "Herein, we show that the formation of coke can be significantly inhibited by introducing CO2 into the PDH over PtFe catalysts, where CO2 effectively eliminates the active Fe(0) coking sites without changing the catalytic surface structure of the PtFe alloy."

[3] "This work provides a promising strategy for tuning the structure of PtFe bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions and improving the performance of the PDH reaction."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates using CO2 to tune the structure of PtFe bimetallic catalysts by selectively oxidizing non-selective Fe sites while preserving the PtFe alloy structure. This helps optimize dispersion of the active phase and improve propane dehydrogenation performance.

[1] "The HR-TEM images are shown in Figure 7, and the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings of Pt and Fe are displayed in Figure S8." 

[2] "The Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalyst after PDH and CO2-PDH showed similar average particle sizes as shown in Figure S9 (9.2 vs 10.0 nm), suggesting that the introduction of CO2 has little effect on sintering."

[3] "A lattice spacing of 2.23 Å was observed for the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1, suggesting the presence of the Pt3Fe1 alloy phase (PDF# 89-2050) after both PDH and CO2-PDH."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article employs HR-TEM and EDS mapping to characterize the metal-support interfaces and particle sizes in the propane dehydrogenation catalysts before and after CO2 treatment. The data suggests CO2 treatment did not significantly change particle size or PtFe alloy structure.
</English version answer>

[1] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed over a spectrometer (Model Max 200, Leybold, Germany) using Al Kα radiation as the excitation source."

[2] "X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements for spent catalysts were conducted on the bending magnet beamline of the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team at the advanced photon source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory, at the Pt LIII edge (11,564 eV) and the Fe K edge (7112 eV)."

[3] "57Fe Mössbauer spectra of the spent catalysts were recorded on a Topologic 500A spectrometer and a proportional counter at room temperature."
</quotes>

<English version answer> 
Answer: The article uses XPS, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and Mössbauer spectroscopy to probe oxidation state changes of Fe and Pt species during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. The data reveals selective oxidation of non-alloyed Fe sites by CO2 while the PtFe alloy phase remains largely unchanged.
