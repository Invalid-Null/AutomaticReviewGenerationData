<quotes>
[1] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed over a spectrometer (Model Max 200, Leybold, Germany) using Al Kα radiation as the excitation source."

[2] "The 57Fe Mössbauer spectra of the spent catalysts were recorded on a Topologic 500A spectrometer and a proportional counter at room temperature." 

[3] "The X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements for spent catalysts were conducted on the bending magnet beamline of the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team at the advanced photon source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory, at the Pt LIII edge (11,564 eV) and the Fe K edge (7112 eV)."

[4] "At the Pt LIII edge, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) coordination parameters were obtained by least-square fit in the R-space (1.2-3.0 Å) of the k3-weighted Fourier transform data from 3.2 to 14.0 Å−1."

[5] "The wavelet analysis of Pt LIII edge EXAFS is shown in Figure S7."

[6] "The ex situ Fe K edge XANES (Figure 6A) spectrum of the Pt1Fe7/S-1 after the PDH reaction lies between Fe(0) foil and Fe3O4, indicating the presence of both Fe(0) and oxidized Fe species due to the exposure to air."

[7] "The iron species of Pt1Fe7/S-1 after the CO2-PDH reaction has obviously higher edge energy and white line intensity, similar to those of Fe3O4."

Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray based techniques including XPS, Mössbauer spectroscopy, XANES, and EXAFS to probe oxidation state changes of Fe species during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. The data and analysis reveal that metallic Fe(0) species are present after regular PDH, but are oxidized to Fe3O4 after PDH with CO2 co-feeding. This indicates that CO2 helps eliminate the metallic Fe(0) species that contribute to coke formation.

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文使用基于X射线的技术,包括XPS、穆斯鲍尔光谱、XANES和EXAFS来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中Fe物种的氧化态变化。数据和分析表明,常规PDH反应后存在金属Fe(0)物种,但在CO2共饲PDH反应后它们被氧化为Fe3O4。这表明CO2有助于消除导致炭化的金属Fe(0)物种。
