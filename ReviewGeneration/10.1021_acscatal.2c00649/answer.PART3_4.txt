[1] "The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images are shown in Figure 7, and the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings of Pt and Fe are displayed in Figure S8."
[2] "Uniform zeolite particles with a diameter of about 160 nm were observed in the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1 after PDH, with a large amount of amorphous carbon species."  
[3] "On the contrary, the amorphous carbon species was hardly observed in the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1 after CO2-PDH."
[4] "Besides, the Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalyst after PDH and CO2-PDH showed similar average particle sizes as shown in Figure S9 (9.2 vs 10.0 nm), suggesting that the introduction of CO2 has little effect on sintering."

5. Yes, the article employs high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to characterize the metal-support interfaces and particle sizes in the propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows uniform 160 nm zeolite particles with PtFe nanoparticles in the spent catalysts. HR-TEM found less amorphous carbon species on the catalyst after CO2-assisted PDH compared to standard PDH. The images suggest CO2 treatment had little effect on metal nanoparticle sintering.

5. 是的,该文献采用了高分辨传输电子显微镜(HR-TEM)和能量散射X射线谱(EDS)来表征丙烷脱氢催化剂中的金属-支撑体界面和粒子大小。它显示了均匀的160纳米沸石粒子与PtFe纳米粒子在使用后的催化剂中。HR-TEM发现CO2辅助的PDH催化剂中无定形碳种类较标准PDH少。该图像表明CO2处理对金属纳米粒子烧结影响很小。

[1] "X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements for spent catalysts were conducted on the bending magnet beamline of the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team at the advanced photon source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory, at the Pt LIII edge (11,564 eV) and the Fe K edge (7112 eV)."
[2] "In the Pt 4f7/2 region, the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalysts after PDH and CO2-PDH both show the peak located at 71.3 eV in Figure 4B, which is assigned to metallic Pt (PtFe alloy) species." 
[3] "These shreds of evidence indicate that most of Fe(0) species in the Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalyst are oxidized during the CO2-PDH reaction, while the platinum species has no significant oxidation."

6. Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Pt LIII and Fe K edges to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows the Pt species remain metallic while the Fe species are oxidized from Fe(0) to Fe3O4 after introducing CO2 to the PDH reaction. This indicates CO2 selectively oxidizes excess Fe sites while preserving the PtFe alloy structure.

6. 是的,该文献使用Pt LIII边和Fe K边的X射线吸收光谱(XAS)来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。它显示Pt物种保持金属态,而Fe物种在向PDH反应中引入CO2后从Fe(0)氧化为Fe3O4。这表明CO2选择性氧化了过量的Fe位点,同时保留了PtFe合金结构。
