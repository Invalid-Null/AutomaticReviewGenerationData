To generate this, I parsed the correct answer XML file to extract the question numbers, English answers, and Chinese answers. I then parsed each answer text file, extracted the English and Chinese answers, and compared them to the corresponding correct answers to calculate a consistency percentage. The percentages were rounded to the nearest 25%. Let me know if you have any other questions!
