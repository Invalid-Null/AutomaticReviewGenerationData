[1] "Fine tuning the structure of bimetallic nanoparticles is critical toward understanding structure-activity relationships and further improving the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."

[2] "Herein, we report a strategy of optimizing the catalytic structure to improve the PDH performance by introducing a soft oxidant CO2, to transform the unalloyed non-selective Fe(0) phase in PtFe bimetallic catalysts."  

[3] "We believe that these results provide insightful understanding toward the PtFe bimetallic catalysts in the PDH reaction and a guideline for fine tuning the catalysts for PDH and other reactions."

[1] "The HR-TEM images are shown in Figure 7, and the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings of Pt and Fe are displayed in Figure S8."

[2] "Uniform zeolite particles with a diameter of about 160 nm were observed in the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1 after PDH, with a large amount of amorphous carbon species. On the contrary, the amorphous carbon species was hardly observed in the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1 after CO2-PDH."

[3] "The element distributions of Pt and Fe are uniform according to the EDS mapping results." 

[4] "A lattice spacing of 2.23 Å was observed for the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1, suggesting the presence of the Pt3Fe1 alloy phase (PDF# 89-2050) after both PDH and CO2-PDH."

26. Yes, the article employs high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping to characterize metal-support interfaces and structures in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It provides images showing uniform zeolite particles and amorphous carbon deposition, along with EDS mapping showing uniform Pt and Fe distribution. Lattice spacing analysis confirmed the presence of PtFe alloy phases.

[1] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed over a spectrometer (Model Max 200, Leybold, Germany) using Al Kα radiation as the excitation source."

[2] "In the Pt 4f7/2 region, the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalysts after PDH and CO2-PDH both show the peak located at 71.3 eV in Figure 4B, which is assigned to metallic Pt (PtFe alloy) species."

[3] "The ex situ Fe K edge XANES (Figure 6A) spectrum of the Pt1Fe7/S-1 after the PDH reaction lies between Fe(0) foil and Fe3O4, indicating the presence of both Fe(0) and oxidized Fe species due to the exposure to air."

[4] "As seen from the Pt LIII edge XANES results (Figure 6B) of Pt1Fe7/S-1 after the PDH and CO2-PDH reaction, the XANES spectra of Pt species are similar to those of the Pt foil, indicating that the Pt species still exist in the metallic form [Pt(0) in the PtFe alloy]."

27. Yes, the article uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES) to probe oxidation state changes of Pt and Fe during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. The data reveals metallic Pt and Fe species after PDH, while after CO2-PDH the Fe is oxidized to Fe3O4 while the Pt remains metallic in the PtFe alloy.
