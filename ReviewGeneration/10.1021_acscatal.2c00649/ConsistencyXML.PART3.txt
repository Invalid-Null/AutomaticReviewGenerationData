To determine the consistency percentages, I compared the key points and conclusions from each answer against the correct answers. Where they completely matched, I assigned 100%. Where there was no match or incorrect information, I assigned 0%.

I hope this analysis is helpful! Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.
