AbstractAbstract
The effect of La calcination temperature on catalytic performance of PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation was studied. XRD, 27Al MAS NMR, NH3-TPD, TEM, H2-TPR and hydrogen chemisorption were used to characterize the catalysts. In contrast to the catalyst without the calcination of La, the treatments in the range of 500–650 °C resulted in the strong interaction between La species and the support, thus suppressing the dealumination of the support to some extent. Furthermore, in these cases the interactions between Sn species and the support as well as Pt and Sn oxides became strengthened, which were advantageous to the reaction. In our experiments, the catalyst when the calcination temperature of La was 650 °C showed the best reaction activity and stability. The average yield of propene was about 34.3% over 82 h for the reaction of propane dehydrogenation at 590 °C. However, after the thermal treatment of La at 700 °C, sharply decreased of the catalyst acidity was inevitable due to the severe dealumination. Meanwhile, sintering of Pt particles and the formation of Sn0 species were also found, which seriously resulted in the deactivation of catalyst. Finally, a model for the effect of La calcined treatment was also proposed.

1. Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene [1], [2], [3]. Indeed, propene is an important raw material for the production of polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile and acrylic acid. However, the reaction of propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that requires a relatively high temperature to obtain high yield of propene. Therefore, it is the key to develop the catalyst possessing high-activity, high-stability and high-selectivity since the deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation is inevitable.
Supported platinum-tin catalysts have been studied in depth, they show high activity and selectivity in the process [4], [5]. However, the reaction stability of these catalysts is still relatively low. As a result of this, the use of new carrier for propane dehydrogenation has received a great deal of attention due to its distinctive structure and property [6], [7]. Recently, the use of ZSM-5 zeolite as a support for propane dehydrogenation is being the subject of an intense research work. Kumar et al. [8] investigated the influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on catalytic properties for propane dehydrogenation and pointed out that three dimensional microporous materials (ZSM-5) were better catalytic supports than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature. Our previous work [9], [10], [11], [12] discussed the effects of promoter and reaction condition on catalytic performances of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and found that the suitable addition of La resulted in the relatively higher propane conversion and propene selectivity. However, worthy mention is that on this reported PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst [12], the promoter of lanthanum was added directly by impregnating the support with a La(NO3)3 aqueous solution, not undergoing the succedent process of calcination. That is to say, relatively weak interactions between lanthanum species and the support may exist, which can affect the catalytic properties significantly.
In deed, calcination is an important factor to influence the catalytic structure and properties [13], especially for the La-doped catalysts. Rane et al. [14] systematically studied the catalyst preparation method on the catalytic properties of Mo-V-Sb-La-Ox catalysts in the oxidation of propane and pointed out that the different calcination time had obvious influence on the catalytic performance. When the calcination time was relatively low, the active sites being responsible for the formation of oxygenated products had not been formed, which resulted in the variation in the reaction conversion and selectivity. Hung [15] studied the calcination temperature on the activity of Cu-La-Ce composite metal catalyst for the catalytic wet oxidation of ammonia solution and reported that the catalyst calcined at 773 K showed the best activity. Since the calcination treatment can affect the catalytic performance of the La containing catalyst significantly, the investigating of this effect is becoming necessary.
In the present work, a series of PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by changing the calcination temperature of La. Particular emphasis was focused on the La–support interactions and the changes of catalyst acidity and Pt characters. All the results were correlated with a corresponding catalytic reaction of propane dehydrogenation. This can provide us with important information to understand the effect of calcination treatment of La on supported metallic catalyst.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by sequential impregnation method. The powder H-ZSM-5 was impregnated in an aqueous solution of 0.123 M La(NO3)3 at 80 °C at first, then dried at 80 °C for 3 h, calcined in an air flow at 500 °C, 550 °C, 600 °C, 650 °C and 700 °C for 4 h, respectively. Afterwards, the samples were impregnated in solutions mixture of 0.033 M H2PtCl6, 0.153 M SnCl4 and 0.427 M NaCl for 4 h.
Then, the prepared catalysts were agglomerated with 5.0 wt% alumina fully during the process of pelletization. After totally dried, the catalysts were re-calcined in air at 500 °C for 4 h. The nominal compositions of the each sample were 0.7 wt% for La, 0.4 wt% for Pt, 0.9 wt% for Sn, and 1.0 wt% for Na. Catalysts used during this investigation were abbreviated as Zx, where x represented the calcination temperature (°C) after the impregnation of lanthanum.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared catalysts were obtained on a XD-3A X-ray powder diffractometer coupled to a copper anode tube. The Kα radiation was selected with a diffracted beam monochromator. An angular ranging from 5° to 40° during 2 h was recorded using step scanning and long counting times to determine the positions of the ZSM-5 peaks.
Solid-state 27Al MAS NMR spectra were collected in a Brucker DSX-400 spectrometer. The 27Al NMR spectra were obtained at 10.0 KHz, using 15° pulses and 4 s delay, a total of 2000 pulses being accumulated.
Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) experiment was measured with a conventional TPD apparatus. About 0.15 g of sample was placed in a quartz reactor and saturated with ammonia at room temperature. TPD was carried out from 100 °C to 550 °C with a heating rate β of 10 °C/min and with helium (30 ml/min) as the carrier gas.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were conducted using JEOL (Japan) instruments. Before being placed on the support, the samples were dispersed in excess ethanol by sonicating for 30 min.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was measured with the same apparatus as that of NH3-TPD. Prior to the TPR experiments, the catalysts were dried in flowing N2 at 400 °C for 1 h. H2/N2 (5%) was used as the reducing gas at a flow rate of 40 ml/min. The rate of temperature rise in the TPR experiment was 10 °C/min up to 700 °C.
Hydrogen chemisorption experiment was performed on the apparatus that described for NH3-TPD. The samples were reduced in flowing H2 at 500 °C for 2 h, then exposed to N2 at 550 °C for 1 h to remove the hydrogen. Details of the experimental procedure have been described elsewhere [16] except that the high temperatures for chemisorption are 300 °C and 450 °C.
2.3. Catalytic reaction
Propane dehydrogenation was carried out in a conventional quartz tubular micro-reactor and all the catalysts were reduced in H2 at 500 °C for 8 h before catalytic evaluation. The catalyst (mass 2.0 g) was placed into the center of the reactor. Reaction conditions were as follows: 590 °C for reaction temperature, 0.1 MPa pressure, H2/C3 = 0.25 (molar ratio) and the propane weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) is 3.0 h−1. The reaction products were analyzed with an online GC-14C gas chromatography.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of catalysts
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the different samples. As can be seen, the XRD patterns of the support have the representative peaks at 7–8° and 23–24°, corresponding to that given in Ref. [17] for pure ZSM-5. In the case of Z0 sample, no changes of the characterized diffraction peaks are observed, indicating that the catalyst preparation without the calcination of La does not destroy the structure of ZSM-5 zeolite. Similarly, it is interesting to note that the changes of the corresponding peaks are not also found clearly after the thermal treatment of La from 500 °C to 700 °C. However, in these instances, the intensities of the corresponding peaks of angle 2θ = 7–8° decrease slightly. Generally, the low-angle XRD intensities in the pattern of ZSM-5 are sensitive to the presence of any species inside the channels [18]. Therefore, these phenomena suggest that the calcined treatment of La can promote the La species to enter into the ZSM-5 channels since the average diameter of La3+ (0.119 nm) is less than that of ZSM-5 pore mouth. Furthermore, as exhibited in Fig. 1, with the increase of calcination temperature, the intensities of the corresponding peaks of angle 2θ = 23–24° decrease gradually, especially for Z700 sample, implying that the crystallinity of the catalyst is degraded after the thermal treatment [19].

27Al MAS NMR spectra for some catalysts in this study are then collected. As shown in Fig. 2, Z0 sample exhibits a relatively strong signal at about 54 ppm, which is attributed to four-coordinated aluminum, and also a weak peak assigned to six-coordinated extra-framework Al (EFAL) at about 0 ppm [20]. When the calcination temperature of La increases from 500 °C to 600 °C, relatively little decrease in the four-coordinated aluminum and increase in the six-coordinated aluminum are observed, suggesting that the calcination of La suppresses the dealumination of the support. Clearly, this behavior caused by the introduction of La is very different with that of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst [10] in the absence of La. It has been found that more framework aluminum atoms can be removed from tetrahedral positions and existed as non-structural Al species on the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst when the calcination temperature increases in the same range. Therefore, this observation can be explained by the existent interactions between La species and the support, which result in the higher thermal stability of the catalyst. At this moment, the location and species of rare earth ions may play an important role in determining this [21]. According to the previous works [22], [23], on ZSM-5 zeolites, the most probable species for the lanthanum cations are La(OH)2+ and these lanthanum ions are favorably accommodated in the two 6-T rings of the straight channels. Through the reduction of La(OH)2+ when heated, LaO(OH) is most likely formed, which can interact with the zeolite and turns out to the structure of Z-La(OH)2+ or Z-LaO(OH) after geometrical optimization [24]. Generally speaking, the Z-La(OH)2+ species can change into the Z-LaO(OH) as the temperature is raised. In this way, the strong interaction between La3+ and the support can partially restrict the breaking of the Si–O–Al bonds of the ZSM-5 zeolite [25], thus preventing the dealumination of the support. In comparison with these, as for the Z700 sample, more severe dealumination is found. These results indicate that the degree of dealumination is mainly depended on the calcination temperature of La and this may be the possible reason for the degraded crystallinity of the catalyst as revealed in Fig. 1.

The desorption of NH3 is used to characterize the acidic properties of surface and this technique can provide some information about the amount and strength of acidic sites. The NH3-TPD profiles of different samples are displayed in Fig. 3 and the results are summarized in Table 1. As can be seen, HZSM-5 sample presents two well-defined peaks at 241 °C and 445 °C; the first peak at low temperature can be assigned to ammonia adsorbed to weak acid sites, while the second peak at high temperature corresponds to ammonia adsorbed to strong acid sites [26]. In a comparison, after the loading of Na (Na/ZSM-5), the strong acid sites disappear and the total acidity decreases effectively, demonstrating that the strong acid sites of the support can be neutralized preferentially by Na+ ion [27]. As regards the PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst without the calcination of La (Z0), the ammonia desorption peak areas at low temperature decrease continuously and the total acidity is only 54% with that of the HZSM-5 support. After the thermal treatment of La (Z500), little increased amount of the weak acid sites and weaker acid intensities are found as evidenced from the ammonia desorption temperature moves towards the lower range. Obviously, the higher the calcination temperature is, the more apparent of this tendency is. The possible reason for this behavior may be attributed to the acidic properties of lanthanum ions. It is known that the La3+ cations are also weak Lewis acid sites [12], thus the aggregation of these acid sites is inevitable with more amounts of La species to enter the main channels of the carrier (Fig. 1). Furthermore, following the analysis by density function calculation in Ref. [24], in the structure of Z-LaO(OH), the La3+ ions can offer the empty tracks (Lewis acid sites), which is used for the adsorption of reactant. Obviously, both of these factors should be responsible for the increased catalyst acidity. However, when the calcination temperature of La is 700 °C, more amounts of Al species can migrate from the framework tetrahedral positions (Fig. 2), which in consequence reduce the amount of the weak acid centers significantly.

The morphology of the various catalysts is characterized by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 4). It can be seen that on catalysts Z0, Z500, Z550, Z600 and Z650 (Fig. 4(a–e)), no agglomerated particles are found on the external surface of the support. Nevertheless, more agglomerated particles appear obviously as the calcination temperature of La increases to 700 °C (Fig. 4(f)). In order to clarify the possibility of Pt sintering, selected area electron diffraction pattern (SADP) taken from the agglomerated particles is shown in Fig. 4(g). By measuring three different groups of ring radius, the diffraction rings can be indexed as (1 1 1), (2 0 0) and (2 2 0) crystal faces of Pt. Therefore, these particles can be identified as Pt phase by diffraction analysis. These observations demonstrate that the calcination temperature of La has an obvious influence on the dispersive status of Pt particles and the high treatment temperature (i.e.700 °C) leads to the sintering of Pt particles. In addition, it is worth noting that the agglomerated mechanism of Pt particles is quite different with that of the previous work [10]. This is because in our experiments the calcination temperature after the loading of Pt is the same (500 °C), while the one after the impregnation of La is different. Consequently, as for the agglomeration of Pt particles on Z700 sample, the influence of heat treatment of La must be considered. As analysis before (Fig. 2), in this case, the carrier experiences relatively severe dealumination. Thus, it is reasonable that the treated catalyst is incapable of stabilizing Sn species effectively, because the existence of aluminum can stabilize the tin species [28]. These unstable Sn species result in the weak surface interactions between Pt and Sn, which in consequence decrease the ability of Pt particles to resist agglomeration.

To get more information about the oxidation and reduction properties of supported noble metals before and after the calcination of La, H2-TPR experiments are then investigated. As shown in Fig. 5, Z0 sample presents a peak, whose maximum is placed at 260 °C, and also two other peaks at about 440 °C and 560 °C, respectively. In general, the signal at 260 °C can be ascribed to reduction of Pt oxide species, whereas the high-temperature peaks represent reduction of Sn4+ to Sn2+ and Sn2+ to Sn0, respectively [29], [30]. With the increase of calcination temperature of La, the reduction peak area of Sn4+ to Sn2+ increases slightly, while the peak area corresponding to Sn2+ to Sn0 species is almost changeless. Moreover, this tendency becomes more apparent as for Z650 sample. Such phenomena indicate that the interactions between Sn species and the support become strengthened and more amounts of tin can exist in oxidative states after the heat treatment of La. To explain these, it should be noted that in these cases the degree of dealumination of the carrier is relatively gentle and more strengthened interactions between La species and the support exist. Thus the role of lanthanum acting as an anti-reducing agent for Sn species can be elaborated more sufficiently [12]. Nevertheless, when the calcined treatment is 700 °C, sharply decreased amounts of hydrogen consumption for Pt species are observed. This fact allows us to confirm that the calcination of La at high temperature can affect the reduction behavior of Pt species obviously. According to the results of TEM (Fig. 4), this can be attributed to the sintering of Pt particles. Besides, as for the Z700 sample, it exhibits the much larger reduction peaks of Sn species at high temperature, suggesting that in this case more amounts of Sn0 components have produced. Similarly, this behavior may be linked with the severe dealumination of the catalyst, which in consequence weakens the interactions between Sn species and the carrier. Usually, keeping the oxidative state of Sn is very important for bimetallic Pt-Sn catalyst and the deactivation of the catalysts is inevitable due to the formation of Pt–Sn alloy [31], [32].

The corresponding H2 uptake of the different samples (Table 2) allows us to confirm this point with great certainty. It is known that H2 chemisorption has been employed as one of the effective methods to determine the metal surface area and dispersion of metallic catalysts. However, the quantitative determination of the surface area by H2 adsorption is interfered by the interaction of Pt with Sn oxide. This neighboring effect can be used as a probe to characterize the properties of different active sites via selective adsorption or temperature programmed desorption of H2. Following Lin et al. [28], two kinds of active Pt species may exist on the surface of the catalyst, named Pt1 sites and Pt2 sites. Pt1 sites are the sites in which Pt directly anchors on the carrier surface, while Pt2 sites corresponding to the sites in which Pt anchors Sn oxide surface with a “sandwich structure”. Generally speaking, the Pt2 sites can adsorb more H2 at high temperature and are the main reaction active sites for the dehydrogenation of propane. As listed in Table 2, the Z0 sample exhibits the different amounts of adsorbed H2 at the corresponding temperature. Also, the amounts of adsorbed H2 at high temperature are relatively large, implying that the main active sites on the external surface of the catalyst are the Pt2 sites. After the heat treatment from 500 °C to 650 °C, the increases in the total amounts of H2 and also the amounts of adsorbed H2 at high temperature are observed, indicating that the calcination of La can promote the formation of Pt2 active sites. As discussed above (Fig. 5), in these cases more amounts of tin exist in oxidative states. In this way, the interactions between Pt and Sn oxides can be strengthened, thus changing the adsorbed activation energy of H2 [28]. Nevertheless, with respect to the Z700 sample, the total amount of absorbed H2 reduces markedly, meaning again that the character of Pt active sites has changed effectively. Meanwhile, it is interesting to note that the amounts of absorbed H2 at high temperature decrease significantly, demonstrating that the thermal treatment of La at severe condition weakens the existent interactions between Pt and Sn oxides. In other words, the anchoring of Pt on Sn oxide surface becomes relatively difficult, thus the intrinsic structure of Pt2 sites with “sandwich structure” would be destroyed to some extent.

3.2. Catalytic performance
Fig. 6 shows the catalytic performance of the different catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. For all samples, the propane conversion decreases, while the selectivity to propene increases with the elongation of reaction time. Clearly, this phenomenon may be interpreted in terms of the effect of produced coke. In this case, the carbon depositions may act as a promoter to improve the selectivity by deactivating the active sites. As depicted in Fig. 6(1), the Z0 sample displays a 34.8% initial conversion. After 7 h on-stream, the propane conversion decreases to 30.9%. In contrast to this, the calcination of La results in the higher reaction activity and stability. For example, when the calcination temperature is 550 °C, the initial conversion increases to 35.4% and the final conversion is 32.0%. In our experiments, the catalyst calcinated at 650 °C exhibits the beat catalytic activity and stability, the maximum initial and final conversions appear as 37.2 and 34.1%, respectively. However, with the continuous increase of calcined temperature, the dehydrogenation activity decreases sharply. As for the Z700 sample, the final propane conversion decreases about 15.5% when comparing with that of the Z650 one. On the other hand, there are no obvious changes in the selectivity to propene when the calcination temperature of La is in the range of 500 °C to 650 °C (Fig. 6(2)). Despite of the poorest reaction activity and stability on Z700 sample, the highest selectivity to propene can be obtained.

To explain these, it should first be noted that the PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst is bifunctional and the two active centers (the metal particle and the acid site) may work collaboratively [33]. From this, it is assumed that an optimum ratio between the number of active sites and the number of acid sites over the catalyst should exist. As commented before, when the calcined temperature of La is 650 °C, the catalyst acidity is relatively more than others (NH3-TPD results). Meanwhile, the introduction of La produces a strong combination with the support, which results in the relatively gentle dealumination of the catalyst and strong interactions between Pt and Sn oxides. So that the better catalytic performance might be obtained due to the optical matching between the acid function and the metallic function. Nevertheless, when the treatment temperature of La increases to 700 °C, more amounts of Al species on the ZSM-5 zeolite have migrated from the framework tetrahedral positions and the catalyst acidity has decreased sharply. Simultaneously, sintering of Pt particles and the formation of Sn0 species are also inevitable, which seriously result in the deactivation of catalyst.
From the other point of view, on PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst platinum is the only active metal and propene is only formed on the metal by dehydrogenation, the main cracking product (ethene) is mainly formed from cracking on the carrier and the ethane is formed by hydrogenolysis of propane and by hydrogenation of ethene, with both reactions taking place on the metal [34]. Furthermore, on HMFI zeolite the dehydrogenation and cracking of propane are assumed to proceed through carbonium-ion intermediates [35]. The higher acid sites generally promote the subsequent cracking reaction of the initially formed C3+carbenium ions. Therefore, the changes of catalytic acidity and Pt active sites should be responsible for the selectivity to propene. As mentioned above, when the calcination temperature of La is below 700 °C, although the amounts of the weak acid sites increase a little, no sintering of Pt particles are observed. That is to say, in these cases, the character of metallic function does not change obviously. However, after the thermal treatment at 700 °C, the acid amount of the catalyst decreases sharply. Furthermore, the degree of Pt sintering is aggravated, which leads to the loss of active sites. The side reactions can be inhibited to some extent in the meantime of the catalyst deactivation. Thus, the increase of propene selectivity is inevitable.
To further assess the performances of Z650 catalyst, the comparisons with the Z0 catalyst by increasing the reaction temperature (610 °C) and using a recycle reaction are also made. As shown in Fig. 7, the propene selectivity decreases gradually with increasing propane conversion. Compared with the Z0 catalyst without the calcination of La, the higher propane conversion and the lower propene selectivity can be found on Z650 sample, suggesting that the thermal treatment of La is favorable for the improvement of the catalytic activity even at higher reaction temperature. Besides, as exhibited in Fig. 8, the initial propane conversions increase after catalyst regeneration. Nevertheless, the propane conversions decrease with the process time and the deactivation rate of the Z0 catalyst is much faster than that of the Z650 catalyst with the increase in recycle number. These results indicate that the remarkable stability in the dehydrogenation reaction can be obtained over Z650 catalyst.

Regeneration conditions: catalyst regeneration was performed by oxidative treatment using pure air (35 ml/min) for 2 h at 500 °C. Then, the catalyst was reduced in flowing pure hydrogen (35 ml/min) for 4 h at 500 °C.
Since the Z650 catalyst shows the highest reaction activity and stability, this catalyst is chosen for the subsequent tests. Fig. 9 shows the stability test of this catalyst. It can be seen that the selectivity to propene increases relatively quickly in the initial period and then becomes smooth, a high value (97.8%) is obtained in the overall process. Meanwhile, only a small deactivation rate is observed in the overall process. The mean yield of propene is about 34.3% during the course of the reaction for 82 h.

3.3. Model for the effects of La calcined treatment on the catalytic performances
According to the results that obtained above, a model for the effects of La calcined treatment is proposed (Fig. 10).

In our experiments, the thermal treatment is carried out after the impregnation of La. In this way, relatively strong interactions between lanthanum species and the support exist. In this contribution, it is suggested that the calcination of La works in the following three ways. First, it improves the thermal stability of the support. As has been observed in XRD and 27Al MAS NMR spectra, more amounts of La species can enter into the ZSM-5 channels and the dealumination of the support can be inhibited when the calcination temperature is less or equal to 650 °C. Thus, it is proposed that the location and species of lanthanum cations should be responsible for the increase in the thermal stability. As mentioned before, the most probable species for the lanthanum cations on ZSM-5 zeolite are La(OH)2+, and these lanthanum ions are favorably accommodated in the two 6-T rings of the straight channels [22]. Through the reduction of La(OH)2+ when heated, LaO(OH) is most likely formed, which can interact with the zeolite and turns out to the structure of Z-La(OH)2+ or Z-LaO(OH) after geometrical optimization [24]. With the increase of temperature, the Z-La(OH)2+ species can change slowly into the Z-LaO(OH) ones, which remains still stable at high temperature. In this way, the introduction of La can partially restrict the breaking of the Si–O–Al bonds of the ZSM-5 zeolite, which in consequence improves the thermal stability of the support. The second role of La calcined treatment relates with its stabilized effect for Sn species. It is well known that the existence of aluminum can stabilize the Sn species. Combined the TPR results with the catalytic performances, it is deduced that more amounts of tin can exist in oxidative states. This stabilized effect likely reflects the influence of a monotonic decrease in the size of Pt ensembles present at the surface of the supported metal particles, together with electronic effects caused by the presence of tin species at the catalyst surface [9]. Third, the calcination of La strengthens the interaction between Pt and Sn oxide, which has been testified by the increased total amounts of adsorbed hydrogen and also the ones at high temperature (Table 2). In this circumstance, the anchoring of tin oxides species on the support becomes strong, which is favorable for the location of Pt active sites and the dispersion of Pt particles. In this case, Pt can anchor Sn oxide surface to form new active sites with “sandwich structure” [28]. These new sites are the main reaction active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction, which result in the higher catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation process.
4. Conclusions
In summary, different calcination temperature of La has obvious influence on the catalytic performance of PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Compared with the catalyst without the calcined treatment of La, the total catalyst acidity increases gradually and the interaction between La species and support becomes strengthened after the thermal treatment from 500 °C to 650 °C. In these cases, the presence of La inhibits the dealumination of the support and also stabilizes the tin species, which result in the strong interaction between Pt and Sn oxides. In our experiments, the Z650 catalyst that calcined at 650 °C possesses the best reaction activity and stability. The mean yield of propene is about 34.3% during the course of the reaction for 82 h. Moreover, this treatment is also beneficial to the improvement of the catalytic activity even at higher reaction temperature (610 °C). However, when the calcination temperature of La is 700 °C, the catalyst acidity decreases sharply due to the relatively severe dealumination. At the same time, the sintering of Pt particles is evidenced by the results of TEM. In this way, the initial matching between the active sites and acid sites on PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst is destroyed, which leads to the irreversible deactivation of the catalyst.
