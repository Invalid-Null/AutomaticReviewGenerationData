<quotes>

[1] "Recently, the use of ZSM-5 zeolite as a support for propane dehydrogenation is being the subject of an intense research work. Kumar et al. [8] investigated the influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on catalytic properties for propane dehydrogenation and pointed out that three dimensional microporous materials (ZSM-5) were better catalytic supports than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature."

[2] "Our previous work [9], [10], [11], [12] discussed the effects of promoter and reaction condition on catalytic performances of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and found that the suitable addition of La resulted in the relatively higher propane conversion and propene selectivity."

</quotes>

<English version answer>

6. Yes, the article evaluates ZSM-5 zeolite supports for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It cites work showing ZSM-5 gave better performance than mesoporous SBA-15, attributed to the microporous structure of ZSM-5.
