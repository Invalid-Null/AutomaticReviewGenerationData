[1] "Supported platinum-tin catalysts have been studied in depth, they show high activity and selectivity in the process [4], [5]." 

[2] "PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst when the calcination temperature of La was 650 C showed the best reaction activity and stability. The average yield of propene was about 34.3% over 82 h for the reaction of propane dehydrogenation at 590 C."

[3] "PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst in the absence of La. It has been found that more framework aluminum atoms can be removed from tetrahedral positions and existed as non-structural Al species on the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst when the calcination temperature increases in the same range."

2. Yes, the article evaluates Pt-Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing a Pt-Sn-Na-La/ZSM-5 catalyst calcined at 650C had the best activity and stability, giving 34.3% propene yield over 82 hours. It also compares performance to a Pt-Sn-Na/ZSM-5 catalyst without La, showing improved thermal stability with La addition.

<quotes>

[1] "Recently, the use of ZSM-5 zeolite as a support for propane dehydrogenation is being the subject of an intense research work. Kumar et al. [8] investigated the influence of the pore geometry of the catalyst supports on catalytic properties for propane dehydrogenation and pointed out that three dimensional microporous materials (ZSM-5) were better catalytic supports than the mesoporous SBA-15 because of their intrinsic nature."

[2] "Our previous work [9], [10], [11], [12] discussed the effects of promoter and reaction condition on catalytic performances of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and found that the suitable addition of La resulted in the relatively higher propane conversion and propene selectivity."

6. Yes, the article evaluates ZSM-5 zeolite supports for propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It cites work showing ZSM-5 gave better performance than mesoporous SBA-15, attributed to the microporous structure of ZSM-5. The article also discusses previous work investigating Pt-Sn-Na/ZSM-5 catalysts, where La addition improved propane conversion and propene selectivity.
