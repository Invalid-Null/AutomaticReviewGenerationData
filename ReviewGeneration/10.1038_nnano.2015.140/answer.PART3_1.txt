 Unfortunately, after carefully reviewing the provided literature, I do not see any relevant information to answer the specific questions about propane dehydrogenation catalysts, zeolites, encapsulation methods, in-situ characterization, advanced microscopy, oxidation state changes, or reactor types. The provided literature focuses on the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic properties of size-selected metal clusters deposited on oxide supports. It does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or any of the other topics mentioned in the questions.
