 Unfortunately, after carefully reviewing the provided literature, I do not see any relevant information to answer the specific questions about propane dehydrogenation catalysts, zeolites, encapsulation methods, in-situ characterization, advanced microscopy, oxidation state changes, or reactor types. The provided literature focuses on the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic properties of size-selected metal clusters deposited on oxide supports. It does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or any of the other topics mentioned in the questions.

 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that directly address any of the specific questions asked. The literature reviews techniques for synthesizing and characterizing size-selected metal clusters prepared by gas-phase methods, and their model catalytic applications under vacuum conditions. It does not discuss zeolite supports, propane dehydrogenation, or compare different reactor types.
