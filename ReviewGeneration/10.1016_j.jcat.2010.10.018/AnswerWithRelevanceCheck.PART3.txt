 ※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※

Based on my assessment, the answers provided do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked. The answers focus on computational modeling studies of propane dehydrogenation over Zn-exchanged zeolite catalysts, but do not address the specific questions asked about catalyst synthesis techniques, metal encapsulation methods, characterization techniques, etc.

Therefore, I have stopped my review process and responded with the single sentence indicating that the answers are not relevant, as instructed.
