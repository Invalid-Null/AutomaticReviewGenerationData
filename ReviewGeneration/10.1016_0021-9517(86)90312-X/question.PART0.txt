I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

The role of sulfur in deactivation of
for propane dehydrogenation
Abstract
Platinum supported on magnesium aluminate spinel is shown to be an efficient catalyst for high-temperature, long-cycle dehydrogenation of lower paraffins. Trace amounts of sulfur in the feed (25500 ppm) suppress both hydrogenolysis and coke formation. Propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with a propylene selectivity of 9294% was maintained over six 24-h reaction/regeneration cycles at 600 C. Catalyst activity fell off sharply after six cycles. This was due to a gradual decrease in platinum dispersion, observed after each catalyst regeneration. The deactivation occurred only in catalysts exposed to sulfur since coke burn-off did not cause platinum sintering in catalysts run without hydrogen sulfide addition to the feed. Platinum on alumina was much more prone to metal sintering in oxidizing environments. The results are discussed in terms of metalsupport interactions and their perturbation by sulfur compounds.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
