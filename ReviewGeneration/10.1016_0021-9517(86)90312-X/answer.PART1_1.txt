<quotes>

[1] "Platinum supported on magnesium aluminate spinel is shown to be an efficient catalyst for high-temperature, long-cycle dehydrogenation of lower paraffins."

[2] "Propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with a propylene selectivity of 9294% was maintained over six 24-h reaction/regeneration cycles at 600 C."  

[3] "Catalyst activity fell off sharply after six cycles. This was due to a gradual decrease in platinum dispersion, observed after each catalyst regeneration."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported platinum catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It shows platinum on magnesium aluminate spinel maintains 28% propane conversion and 92-94% propylene selectivity over 6 reaction cycles at 600°C. However, platinum dispersion decreases after each regeneration leading to sharp activity loss after 6 cycles.

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,该文评估了负载铂催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它表明,镁铝酸盐衬托的铂催化剂在600°C下经过6个反应循环后,丙烷转化率可达28%,丙烯选择性可达92-94%。然而,每次再生后铂的分散度都有所下降,导致催化剂活性在6个循环后急剧下降。

<quotes>

[1] "The deactivation occurred only in catalysts exposed to sulfur since coke burn-off did not cause platinum sintering in catalysts run without hydrogen sulfide addition to the feed." 

[2] "Platinum on alumina was much more prone to metal sintering in oxidizing environments."

[3] "The results are discussed in terms of metalsupport interactions and their perturbation by sulfur compounds."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like platinum particle size, shape, and support interactions affect performance. It shows sulfur exposure causes platinum sintering and deactivation, while coke burn-off does not impact unsupported platinum. Platinum on alumina is more prone to sintering than spinel support. Results suggest metal-support interactions play a role, perturbed by sulfur.

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,该文研究了铂粒子大小、形状和载体作用等性质如何影响催化剂性能。结果表明,硫暴露会导致铂粒状化和失活,而焦炭燃烧不会影响无载体铂催化剂。相比莫来石载体,氧化铝载体上的铂更易粒状化。结果提示金属-载体间相互作用发挥了作用,但会被硫化物扰乱。
