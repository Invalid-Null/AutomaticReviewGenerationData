<quotes>

[1] "Platinum supported on magnesium aluminate spinel is shown to be an efficient catalyst for high-temperature, long-cycle dehydrogenation of lower paraffins."

[2] "Propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with a propylene selectivity of 9294% was maintained over six 24-h reaction/regeneration cycles at 600 C."  

[3] "Catalyst activity fell off sharply after six cycles. This was due to a gradual decrease in platinum dispersion, observed after each catalyst regeneration."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported platinum catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Data shows platinum on magnesium aluminate spinel gave 28% propane conversion and 92-94% propylene selectivity over 6 reaction cycles at 600°C before deactivating due to platinum sintering.   
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,该文评估了载体铂催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。数据显示,铂在镁铝酸盐尖晶石上的转化率为28%,丙烯选择性为92-94%,在600°C下经过6个反应循环后,由于铂粒子团聚导致活性下降。

[1] "Catalyst activity fell off sharply after six cycles. This was due to a gradual decrease in platinum dispersion, observed after each catalyst regeneration." 

[2] "The deactivation occurred only in catalysts exposed to sulfur since coke burn-off did not cause platinum sintering in catalysts run without hydrogen sulfide addition to the feed."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how platinum particle size and support interactions affect performance. It shows platinum dispersion and particle growth on spinel support causes deactivation, accelerated by sulfur exposure. Sintering was not observed without sulfur.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,该文研究了铂颗粒大小和支持体相互作用如何影响性能。它表明铂在尖晶石载体上的分散度和颗粒生长会导致脱活,而硫暴露会加速这个过程。在没有硫的情况下没有观察到烧结。
