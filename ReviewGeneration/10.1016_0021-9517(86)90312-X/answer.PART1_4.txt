[1] "Platinum supported on magnesium aluminate spinel is shown to be an efficient catalyst for high-temperature, long-cycle dehydrogenation of lower paraffins."

[2] "Propane conversion in excess of 28 mol% with a propylene selectivity of 9294% was maintained over six 24-h reaction/regeneration cycles at 600 C."  

[3] "Catalyst activity fell off sharply after six cycles. This was due to a gradual decrease in platinum dispersion, observed after each catalyst regeneration."  

[4] "The deactivation occurred only in catalysts exposed to sulfur since coke burn-off did not cause platinum sintering in catalysts run without hydrogen sulfide addition to the feed."  

[5] "Platinum on alumina was much more prone to metal sintering in oxidizing environments."  

[6] "The results are discussed in terms of metalsupport interactions and their perturbation by sulfur compounds."

Answer: Yes, the article evaluates supported mono-metallic platinum catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows platinum on magnesium aluminate spinel to be an efficient catalyst, maintaining 28 mol% propane conversion and 92-94% propylene selectivity over six 24-hour cycles at 600°C before deactivating. Deactivation was attributed to decreasing platinum dispersion after each regeneration in sulfur-containing feeds. In contrast, platinum on alumina was more prone to sintering issues. The results highlight the role of metal-support interactions and their disruption by sulfur in governing stability.

Answer: 是的,该文评估了载体单金属铂催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它表明铂在硅酸镁铝尖晶石上的催化剂效率很高,在600°C下保持28mol%的丙烷转化率和92-94%的丙烯选择性通过了6个24小时循环后失活。失活归因于每次再生后硫化物存在的反应料中铂分散度的降低。相比之下,氧化铝载体上的铂更容易发生烧结问题。结果强调了金属与载体的相互作用及其在稳定性方面的硫化物扰动起关键作用。

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how properties like platinum particle size, dispersion, and support interactions affect performance. It shows sulfur exposure causes platinum sintering and loss of dispersion, deactivating the catalysts. Magnesium aluminate spinel helps mitigate this issue compared to alumina. The results reveal metal-support interactions play a key role in governing platinum particle growth and stability.
