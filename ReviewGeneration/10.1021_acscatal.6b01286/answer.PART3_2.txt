[1] "The iron-based catalyst precursors were synthesized via a dry impregnation method."

[2] "In a typical synthesis (mole ratio of Fe:P = 3:1 as example), 5.76 g of citric acid (0.03 mol), 0.66 g of (NH4)2HPO4 (0.005 mol), and 6.06 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.015 mol) were mixed in a centrifugation vial."

[3] "The calcination step was as follows: a ramp rate of 5 C/min with a 6 h hold at 600 C and then cooling to room temperature within 8 h."

[1] "In situ XAS measurements at the Fe K-edge (ca. 7112 eV) were carried out to gain insight into the changes of the Fe species during the reaction."

[2] "The XANES data can provide useful information regarding the electronic properties (i.e., oxidation state) of the metal centers." 

[3] "The R spaces of the EXAFS spectra are plotted in Figure 11b. Before the reduction, the strongest signal was at ca. 1.4 Å, associated with the FeO bond. After H2 pretreatment, a strong peak appeared at ca. 2.2 Å, together with a weakening of the peak at 1.4 Å, indicating the formation of metallic Fe domains (see Fe foil standard) and fewer iron oxide species."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It provides XANES data showing changes in iron oxidation state during reaction. It also provides EXAFS data revealing transformations from Fe-O bonds to Fe-Fe metallic bonds during catalyst reduction.

[2] "The XANES data can provide useful information regarding the electronic properties (i.e., oxidation state) of the metal centers."

[3] "As the PDH reaction time increased, the signal intensity at ca. 7115 eV kept decreasing until a steady-state value was reached." 

[4] "The final spectrum in Figure 11a is similar to the spectrum of Fe3C in their work, which suggests that iron carbide like species are formed during PDH, consistent with the ex situ XRD analysis discussed above."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It provides XANES data showing decreasing intensity of the Fe(III) pre-edge peak during reaction, suggesting reduction of iron species. It also compares final XAS spectra to known Fe3C spectra, consistent with iron carbide formation.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文章使用了X射线吸收谱技术来探究丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。文章提供了XANES数据,显示Fe(III)前缘峰强度在反应过程中减弱,提示铁物种被还原。文章还将最终的XAS谱与已知的Fe3C谱进行了比较,与铁碳化物的生成一致。
