[1] "As can be seen in Figure 11a, for the (3Fe:P)/Al2O3 catalyst prior to H2 reduction (precursor), the pre-edge energy of the 3d orbital transition was at ca. 7114.5 eV, indicating the presence of Fe(III) species."

[2] "After H2 reduction, the pre-edge peak disappeared. Moreover, as the PDH reaction time increased, the signal intensity at ca. 7115 eV kept decreasing until a steady-state value was reached." 

[3] "Walton's group studied the chlorination of iron carbide by XAS and the final spectrum in Figure 11a is similar to the spectrum of Fe3C in their work, which suggests that iron carbide like species are formed during PDH, consistent with the ex situ XRD analysis discussed above."
