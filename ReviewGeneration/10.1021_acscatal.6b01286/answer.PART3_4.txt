[1] "The iron-based catalyst precursors are synthesized via a dry impregnation method."

[2] "In a typical synthesis (mole ratio of Fe:P = 3:1 as example), 5.76 g of citric acid (0.03 mol), 0.66 g of (NH4)2HPO4 (0.005 mol), and 6.06 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.015 mol) were mixed in a centrifugation vial."

[3] "The calcination step was as follows: a ramp rate of 5 C/min with a 6 h hold at 600 C and then cooling to room temperature within 8 h."

Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes using a dry impregnation method to synthesize iron-based catalyst precursors with different Fe:P ratios. A specific example is provided for a 3:1 Fe:P ratio precursor made by mixing iron nitrate, ammonium phosphate, and citric acid, followed by calcination.

[1] "In situ XAS measurements at the Fe K-edge (ca. 7112 eV) were carried out to gain insight into the changes of the Fe species during the reaction."

[2] "The XANES data can provide useful information regarding the electronic properties (i.e., oxidation state) of the metal centers." 

[3] "The R spaces of the EXAFS spectra are plotted in Figure 11b. Before the reduction, the strongest signal was at ca. 1.4 Å, associated with the FeO bond. After H2 pretreatment, a strong peak appeared at ca. 2.2 Å, together with a weakening of the peak at 1.4 Å, indicating the formation of metallic Fe domains (see Fe foil standard) and fewer iron oxide species."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it performs XAS measurements at the iron K-edge during propane dehydrogenation over an iron-based catalyst. The XANES data provides information on oxidation state changes, while the EXAFS data reveals changes in Fe-Fe and Fe-O bonds during the reaction, indicating the transformation of iron oxide species to metallic iron and then iron carbide.
