 Here is the analysis comparing the answer files to the correct answers:

  }
}
```

I parsed the correct answer text and each comparative answer text to extract the relevant quotes and answers. I compared the quotes and answers in each file to the correct answers to determine consistency percentages. The analysis shows high consistency overall, with a few cases of lower consistency likely due to incomplete quoting of the original text. Let me know if you have any other questions!
