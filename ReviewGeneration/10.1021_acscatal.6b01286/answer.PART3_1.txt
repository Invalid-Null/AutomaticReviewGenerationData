[1] "The iron-based catalyst precursors are synthesized via a dry impregnation method."

[2] "In a typical synthesis (mole ratio of Fe:P = 3:1 as example), 5.76 g of citric acid (0.03 mol), 0.66 g of (NH4)2HPO4 (0.005 mol), and 6.06 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.015 mol) were mixed in a centrifugation vial." 

[3] "The calcination step was as follows: a ramp rate of 5 C/min with a 6 h hold at 600 C and then cooling to room temperature within 8 h."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes using a dry impregnation method with citric acid to synthesize iron-based catalyst precursors, controlling the calcination ramp rate and temperature, and varying the Fe:P ratio.

[1] "In situ XAS measurements at the Fe K-edge (ca. 7112 eV) were carried out to gain insight into the changes of the Fe species during the reaction."

[2] "The XANES data can provide useful information regarding the electronic properties (i.e., oxidation state) of the metal centers."

[3] "The R spaces of the EXAFS spectra are plotted in Figure 11b. Before the reduction, the strongest signal was at ca. 1.4 Å, associated with the FeO bond. After H2 pretreatment, a strong peak appeared at ca. 2.2 Å, together with a weakening of the peak at 1.4 Å, indicating the formation of metallic Fe domains (see Fe foil standard) and fewer iron oxide species."

[1] "XPS was utilized to characterize the speciation of phosphorus, as shown in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information."

[2] "It was observed that there was a broad peak centered at ca. 134.9 eV representing P2p1/2 and P2p3/2 binding energies, which is supported by prior studies characterizing iron(III) phosphate and iron(II) phosphate." 

[3] "The current results are also in accord with the XRD observation that the phosphorus element existed in either phosphate (PO43) or pyrophosphate (P2O74) form during the reaction."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to probe the oxidation state of phosphorus species. It shows a broad peak at 134.9 eV corresponding to phosphate and pyrophosphate species, consistent with XRD results.
