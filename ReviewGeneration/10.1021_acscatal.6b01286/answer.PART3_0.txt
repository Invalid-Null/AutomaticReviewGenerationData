[1] "The iron-based catalyst precursors are synthesized via a dry impregnation method."

[2] "In a typical synthesis (mole ratio of Fe:P = 3:1 as example), 5.76 g of citric acid (0.03 mol), 0.66 g of (NH4)2HPO4 (0.005 mol), and 6.06 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.015 mol) were mixed in a centrifugation vial."

[3] "The calcination step was as follows: a ramp rate of 5 °C/min with a 6 h hold at 600 °C and then cooling to room temperature within 8 h."

[4] "This resulting precursor powder contained FePO4 (and Fe2O3 depending on the Fe:P ratio in the recipe)."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It describes using a dry impregnation method to synthesize iron-based catalyst precursors with different Fe:P ratios. The precursors were calcined at 600°C to obtain powders containing dispersed FePO4 and Fe2O3 domains.

[1] "In situ XAS measurements at the Fe K-edge (ca. 7112 eV) were carried out to gain insight into the changes of the Fe species during the reaction." 

[2] "The XANES data can provide useful information regarding the electronic properties (i.e., oxidation state) of the metal centers."

[3] "Meanwhile, the R spaces of the EXAFS spectra are plotted in Figure 11b." 

[4] "The new peak is suggested to be associated with Fe-C bonds in Fe3C. Such observations are consistent with the transformation of Fe(0) to Fe3C species, as also described above."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It examines changes in the oxidation state and bonding environment of iron species during the reaction using XANES and EXAFS data. The measurements reveal the transformation of metallic Fe to iron carbide Fe3C under reaction conditions.

[1] "As can be seen in Figure 11a, for the (3Fe:P)/Al2O3 catalyst prior to H2 reduction (precursor), the pre-edge energy of the 3d orbital transition was at ca. 7114.5 eV, indicating the presence of Fe(III) species."

[2] "After H2 reduction, the pre-edge peak disappeared. Moreover, as the PDH reaction time increased, the signal intensity at ca. 7115 eV kept decreasing until a steady-state value was reached." 

[3] "Walton's group studied the chlorination of iron carbide by XAS and the final spectrum in Figure 11a is similar to the spectrum of Fe3C in their work, which suggests that iron carbide like species are formed during PDH, consistent with the ex situ XRD analysis discussed above."
</quotes>

<English version answer> 
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows that the pre-edge peak associated with Fe(III) disappears after H2 reduction, indicating reduction to metallic Fe. The peak continues to decrease during reaction as Fe(0) transforms to iron carbide Fe3C species.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,文中使用了X射线吸收光谱技术来检测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。结果显示,H2还原后与Fe(III)相关的临界峰消失,表示被还原为金属Fe。在反应过程中,随着Fe(0)向碳化铁Fe3C的转化,该峰继续减小。
