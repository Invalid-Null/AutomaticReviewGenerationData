<quotes>
[1] "A series of alumina-supported Fe-based catalysts is prepared via a dry impregnation method in the presence of a phosphorus source (phosphate salt) and then used for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."

[2] "The iron and phosphorus contents remained constant during the reaction, and the corresponding atomic ratios roughly followed those of the preparation recipe."

[3] "Meanwhile, varied amounts of coke were found in the catalysts after 6 h of reaction."

[4] "The addition of the phosphorus source in the precatalyst is found to be important in obtaining a catalyst with superior performance."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. Specifically, it prepares alumina-supported iron-based catalysts using a dry impregnation method with a phosphorus source to control dispersion. The iron and phosphorus contents remained constant during reaction, indicating good dispersion was achieved initially.

[1] "In situ XAS measurements at the Fe K-edge (ca. 7112 eV) were carried out to gain insight into the changes of the Fe species during the reaction."

[2] "As the PDH reaction time increased, the signal intensity at ca. 7115 eV kept decreasing until a steady-state value was reached." 

[3] "After H2 pretreatment, a strong peak appeared at ca. 2.2 Å, together with a weakening of the peak at 1.4 Å, indicating the formation of metallic Fe domains (see Fe foil standard) and fewer iron oxide species."

[4] "As the PDH reaction started, the FeFe bond intensity decreased along with an increase of a peak at ca. 1.5 Å. The new peak is suggested to be associated with FeC bonds in Fe3C."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it tracks changes in the Fe species during reaction using XAS at the Fe K-edge. The results reveal formation of metallic Fe after H2 reduction, and subsequent transformation to iron carbide Fe3C under reaction conditions.

<English version answer> 
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Specifically, it performs in-situ XAS at the Fe K-edge to track changes in Fe species. The results reveal the reduction of iron oxide to metallic Fe after H2 pretreatment, and subsequent formation of iron carbide Fe3C under reaction conditions.
