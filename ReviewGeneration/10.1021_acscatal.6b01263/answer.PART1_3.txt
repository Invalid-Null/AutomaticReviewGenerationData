[1] "A recent literature survey by Carrero et al. (3) has highlighted that, in the absence of crystalline vanadia, the profiles of propylene selectivity versus propane conversion are similar for all catalysts; the extrapolated propylene selectivity at propane conversion values close to zero tends to nearly 100%."

[2] "These observations are in a good agreement with the behavior of the IWI-catalysts at 525 C. The selectivity for IWI-0.98 is high at low propane conversion (a value of ca. 85% can be extrapolated at zero propane conversion, in a good agreement with recently reported, well-dispersed silica-supported vanadia catalysts (4e)) and drops rapidly to a value of roughly 62% by 13% propane conversion."

[3] "The propylene selectivity of 3 at 525 C is observed to remain constant (66%) up to ca. 12% propane conversion and it drops slightly (ca. 55%) for a propane conversion of about 20%." 

[4] "As an effect, the propylene selectivity of 3 extrapolated at low propane
