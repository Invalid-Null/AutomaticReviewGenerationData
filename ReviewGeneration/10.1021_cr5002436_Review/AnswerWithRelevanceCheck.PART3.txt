      [1] "Furthermore, in situ spectroscopic techniques made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. As is shown in Figure 14 with XANES and in Figure 15 with UV-vis spectroscopy, it was observed that surface Cr3+ species are produced at the expense of Cr6+ species during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction and that polychromate is more easily reduced than monochromate."

      [2] "Parenthetically, the involvement of hydrocarbons in the formation of reduced active chromium sites, the participation of both chromium and oxygen atoms in the reaction, and the proposition that CH activation represents the first reaction step are somewhat reminiscent of the Phillips catalyst and of the mechanism of ethylene polymerization recently proposed by Copret and co-workers over this formulation."

      [3] "Therefore, the monitoring of industrial chromia-alumina catalysts by combined time-resolved UV-vis and Raman spectroscopies can be employed to improve the overall efficiency of future alkane dehydrogenation processes."

      One article utilizes in situ XANES and UV-vis spectroscopy to study CrOx/Al2O3 propane dehydrogenation catalysts. The data reveals Cr6+ reduction to Cr3+ during initial reaction stages. It also suggests using combined operando UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy to monitor industrial CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts.
