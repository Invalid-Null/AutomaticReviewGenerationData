Catalytic Dehydrogenation of Light Alkanes on Metals and Metal Oxides
1 Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
1.1 Setting the Scene
Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry. Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde). (1-4) The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn. (5) In Figure 1, the uses as well as the recent and predicted future growth of the olefin supply and demand are shown. (6) Steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts are the most common methods for obtaining these light olefins. For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced. (7)

A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies. In recent years, hydraulic fracturing or fracking technologies have improved to the point where large volumes of shale gas can be extracted in a cost-effective manner. In fact, the United States already obtains one-quarter of their natural gas production from shale gas deposits, and this is expected to rise even further in the coming years due to the emphasis that is being given to the attainment of energy independence. (8, 9) This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals. This includes light olefins, which can be obtained by first converting natural gas into synthesis gas and by subsequently converting the latter either directly through the FischerTropsch-to-olefins (FTO) process or indirectly through the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) route with an intermediate methanol synthesis step. (10, 11)

aLarger hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and oxygen are present in trace amounts and are not given. (12)
As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas. (13) Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council. (14)
The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted. Relative to naphtha cracking, steam cracking of ethane produces a negligible amount of olefins other than ethylene, which is why the supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen sharply, creating opportunities for on-purpose catalytic technologies, such as the catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins into the corresponding olefins. (15) Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable. An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products. In fact, industrial dehydrogenation processes are currently optimized in such a way that they can produce olefins of polymer-quality purity. As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH). (16, 17) However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction. (18-21)
Notably, there is a similarly advantageous market situation for the dehydrogenation of butanes, because the same conditions apply. Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices. This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan. (22-25)
1.2 Scope of This Review
Because dehydrogenation for the production of light olefins has become extremely relevant in recent times, we aim to provide the reader with a complete overview of the materials used to catalyze this reaction. First, we will introduce the subject by considering the industrial processes that have been patented and applied and the thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation reaction. Next, the Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts that are currently used in commercial processes will be examined in detail. Additionally, other metal oxides, such as GaOx, VOx, MoOx, and InOx, which have also proven to be promising dehydrogenation catalysts will be surveyed. For each catalytic material, relevant factors, such as the specific nature of the active sites, as well as the effect of support, promoters, and reaction feed on catalyst performance and lifetime, will be discussed. Finally, we will compare different catalysts both in terms of the reaction mechanism and deactivation pathways and in terms of catalytic performance. To the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to compare such a wide range of dehydrogenation catalysts in a single review article, although other reviews have been published in recent years dealing with the dehydrogenation of light paraffins. For example, Bhasin et al. wrote an extensive review on the industrial application of dehydrogenation technologies in 2001, which includes a comparative discussion of the state of the art of oxidative dehydrogenation technologies. (26) Two more review articles by Vora and Bricker (UOP) were published in 2012. In the first review article, Vora gives a general overview of the dehydrogenation of light olefins and ethylbenzene on Pt-based catalysts, discussing important principles for catalyst and reactor design. (27) In the second review paper, Bricker addresses catalyst design in more detail, emphasizing mass transfer and the use of selective hydrogen combustion to increase olefin yield. (28) Other reviews focusing on a specific family of dehydrogenation catalysts have also been published. For example, Weckhuysen and Schoonheydt reviewed the dehydrogenation of alkanes on supported chromium oxide catalysts in 1999. (29) Dehydrogenation of alkanes on vanadium and chromium oxides is also discussed by Jackson et al. in a book on metal oxide catalysis published in 2009. (30) The chemistry of vanadium oxide for oxidative dehydrogenation has been further discussed in a review by Albonetti et al. (31) Another review by Cavani et al. discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane on supported vanadium and molybdenum oxides. The authors conclude that, although the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane has potential, the oxidative dehydrogenation of higher paraffins is still far from being commercially applied. (32) The nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light paraffins on both supported and bulk transition metal oxides has also been discussed by Copret in a review focused on CH bond activation. (33) Also of note are three reviews by Krylov, Wang, and Ansari, where the use of CO2 as a mild oxidant for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes is discussed. (34-36) Finally, in a chapter by Caspary et al. in the most recent edition of the Handbook of Heterogeneous Catalysis, the dehydrogenation of alkanes is discussed broadly, albeit emphasis is placed on CrOx and Pt catalysts, on the kinetics and mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction, and on reactor technology. (37)
2 Commercial Dehydrogenation Processes
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
To date, five main industrial processes for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes have been patented, two of which are currently being used to produce light olefins. (38-41) As of April 2012, 5 million tons of propylene was being produced by the 14 propane dehydrogenation plants around the globe. (16, 17) The global demand of propylene was 103 million tons that year and is expected to increase by 45% on a yearly basis. (42, 43) Literally dozens of new installations have been planned or are already under construction, amounting to an additional 14 million tons of propylene to be produced annually by 2018. (16, 17, 44) Additionally, six isobutane dehydrogenation installations are currently in operation, with three other plants planned. (43) The majority of these new facilities will be built in China or the United States and will use either the Catofin (Lummus) or the Oleflex (UOP) technologies. A compilation of all existing and planned propane dehydrogenation installations is shown in Figure 2. Furthermore, in Table 2, a comparison is made between the two most important processes, Catofin and Oleflex. The STAR (UHDE) process will be applied for the first time in two installations in the Middle East. The other two processes, fluidized bed dehydrogenation (FBD) process (Snamprogetti and Yarsintez) and Linde-BASF PDH, have not yet been commercially applied.

World map showing an overview of propane dehydrogenation installations currently in operation (filled shapes) and installations that have been announced and are expected to start up before 2018 (unfilled shapes). The numbers represent the maximum production of each plant (×1000 tons per year). The locations of the facilities are approximations. (16, 17, 44, 45) For some of the newly announced PDH installations (), the industrial process to be used remains to be announced.
2.1 Catofin Process
The Catofin process, by CB&I Lummus, is based on the Houdry Catadiene process, which originally was exclusively used for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene. In turn, isobutene was employed for the production of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), a fuel additive used to raise the octane number of gasoline. For environmental reasons, the use of MTBE has declined in recent years, causing a shift in the use of Catofin installations to alternative purposes, such as propane dehydrogenation. A Catofin installation generally consists of 58 parallel adiabatic fixed bed reactors containing a chromiaalumina catalyst. The reaction is run at temperatures of approximately 575 C and pressures between 0.2 and 0.5 bar. (26) Each reactor alternates between dehydrogenation, regeneration, and purge steps, each lasting a few minutes (1530 min being needed for one full cycle). Each individual reactor is made to run continuously so there are always some units performing dehydrogenation reactions, while other reactors are being regenerated or purged, which results in a constant flow of reaction products. (46) A schematic of a Catofin dehydrogenation installation is shown in Figure 3. The duration of the dehydrogenation step depends on the heat content of the catalyst bed, which decreases rapidly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. Part of the heat required for the reaction is introduced to the reactors by preheating the reaction feed, additional heat being provided by adjacent reactors that are regenerating the coked catalysts. Moreover, fuel gas is added to the reactor during the regeneration step to generate supplementary heat, (47) and inert material is added to the catalyst bed to increase its heat storage capacity. (48) The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span. (29, 49)

Olefins produced are separated from side products that are subsequently mixed with oxygen and combusted to heat the reactors during the regeneration step.
2.2 Oleflex Process
The Oleflex process by UOP uses a very different reactor design comprising fluidized bed reactors, a catalyst regeneration unit, and a product recovery section. A schematic representation is shown in Figure 4. (50) The reaction is run using a PtSn-based catalyst at pressures between 1 and 3 bar and temperatures ranging from 525 to 705 C. Three or four adiabatic radial flow reactors containing the catalyst are connected in series with preheaters in between. These gas flow preheaters represent the main source of heat of the reactor system. The catalyst flows through the system, the last reactor being connected to a continuous catalyst regeneration (CCR) unit that regenerates the catalyst by burning of any carbon deposits and redisperses the Pt on the support material by means of treating the catalyst with a chlorineair mixture. The entire system is designed to operate continuously to obtain an uninterrupted stream of reaction products. The regenerated catalyst is then reintroduced to the first reactor, completing an entire cycle every 510 days. Product recovery is done by cooling, compressing, and drying the reactor effluent, hydrogen being cryogenically separated from the hydrocarbons. The latter are led through a selective hydrogenation unit to remove diolefins and acetylenes. Polymer-quality propylene is obtained after flowing the hydrocarbons through a de-ethanizer and a propanepropylene splitter. More detailed information on the Catofin and Oleflex processes is presented in Table 2.

catalyst lifetime 23 years before the reactor is shut down and the catalyst is replaced; catalyst lifetime is prolonged by increasing the temperature to maintain high propylene yield at the cost of lower selectivity 13 years, new catalyst being continuously added to the reactor system and dusts formed due to catalyst attrition being continually removed
2.3 Other Patented Alkane Dehydrogenation Processes
The Steam Active Reforming (STAR) process developed by Uhde utilizes a very different reactor setup. The reaction is run at 69 bar and at temperatures between 500 and 600 C, steam being added to the feed to reduce paraffin partial pressure and coke formation. Because the catalyst has to be stable in the presence of steam, PtSn supported on a (basic) zincaluminate is used with calcium/magnesiumaluminate as a binder. Very little coke is deposited on the catalyst surface, and thus dehydrogenation cycles may be as long as 7 h before regeneration becomes necessary.
A fixed bed reactor system is used, consisting of two separate reactors placed in series. (37, 56) The first is a top-fired tubular reformer-type reactor, which is externally heated by an oven. Most of the heat is provided at the top of the reactor, where the dehydrogenation activity is highest. The gas mixture exiting the first reactor is cooled prior to being introduced into the second so-called oxyreactor, where an oxygensteam mixture is used to selectively combust part of the hydrogen formed, shifting the equilibrium toward higher olefin yields. In addition, the combustion of hydrogen provides the heat required for the additional conversion of propane. The olefins in the resulting gas mixture are separated from any residual hydrogen and other side products, which are combusted to heat the dehydrogenation reactor oven. A schematic representation of this reactor setup is shown in Figure 5. Currently, two dehydrogenation installations using the Uhde STAR process are being constructed in Egypt and Iran.

The system comprises two fixed bed reactors, one located in an oven and an oxyreactor where hydrogen is combusted. A simplified version of the gas separation unit used to separate the olefins from paraffins, cracking products, and residual hydrogen is shown.
Figure 6 shows a schematic representation of the Fluidized Bed Dehydrogenation (FBD) process, licensed by Snamprogetti and Yarsintez, in which a fluid catalytic cracking-like reactor system is used for the dehydrogenation of propane. An alkane is flowed through a staged fluidized bed at pressures between 1.1 and 1.5 bar and temperatures between 550 and 600 C. A CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, promoted with an alkali metal, is used. The catalyst deactivates over time and is therefore continuously transported to a regenerator connected to the reactor to combust the carbon deposits. The heat required for the dehydrogenation reaction is provided by heating the catalyst material to temperatures above 700 C in the regenerator. A fuel gas is routinely added during regeneration as the combustion of the carbon deposits alone does not provide enough heat to achieve these temperatures. Upon its return to the reactor, the catalyst cools again to temperatures below 560 C. Finally, a system comprising a jet scrubber and cyclones in the head of the reactor is used to remove any dust formed by catalyst attrition. (48)

The Linde-BASF PDH process, of which a schematic representation is shown in Figure 7, uses a PtSn catalyst supported on ZrO2 for dehydrogenating light paraffins isothermally at a temperature of 590 C. The process shows various similarities with the STAR process, as the reaction feed is diluted with steam and an externally heated fixed bed reactor is used. Three of these reactors operate in parallel, with two in dehydrogenation and one in regeneration mode, ensuring a continuous flow of reaction products. A mixture of air and steam is used to regenerate the catalyst, and the reactor is purged before and after the regeneration step. (37)

3 Thermodynamics of Nonoxidative Alkane Dehydrogenation
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
From the chemical perspective, dehydrogenation is a one-step reaction through which light paraffins can be converted into the corresponding olefins and hydrogen, as illustrated below for the dehydrogenation of propane:
However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions. Indeed, temperatures of 550750 C are typically required in the dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins to obtain alkane conversions 50% at 1 bar (see Figure 8). Moreover, given that the enthalpy required to dehydrogenate alkanes decreases as the chain becomes longer (ΔH2980 = 137 kJ mol1 for ethane, 124.3 kJ mol1 for propane, and 117.6 kJ mol1 for isobutane dehydrogenation), a considerably larger amount of energy is required to dehydrogenate light paraffins on a mass basis. The pressure dependence is also shown in Figure 8, lower pressures clearly resulting in higher olefin yields at a given temperature.
Figure 8
Figure 8. Equilibrium conversion of C2C4 paraffins to olefins as a function of temperature at 1 bar (left) and pressure dependence of the dehydrogenation of propane as a function of temperature (right).
The CH bonds in paraffins and olefins are considerably more reactive than CC bonds, meaning that catalysts that favor CH over CC bond cleavage are required to avoid side reactions. An additional complicating factor is that olefins are considerably more reactive than their paraffinic counterparts, which can further lead to unwanted side and secondary reactions. Three types of side reactions can occur, hydrogenolysis, cracking, and isomerization. In hydrogenolysis, the addition of hydrogen into a CC bond within a paraffin results in the formation of two smaller alkanes. Because hydrogen adatoms and/or CxHy adspecies are required for alkane hydrogenolysis to occur, (57, 58) this reaction is believed to be catalyzed by Pt sites. Cracking also results in the cleavage of a paraffin to form two smaller hydrocarbons, although in this instance no hydrogen is required. Thermal cracking hardly occurs at dehydrogenation reaction conditions, as it requires temperatures of 450750 C and pressures of 570 bar. This reaction proceeds via the formation of radical intermediates, which rearrange into an alkane and an alkene. Catalytic cracking is different in the sense that it requires a catalyst with Brnsted and Lewis acidity and proceeds via the formation of a carbocation intermediate, albeit it also results in the formation of an alkene and an alkane. (59-61) Isomerization is the rearrangement of atoms within a molecule. For example, during the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene, the former may transform to 1- or 2-butene, which may dehydrogenate further to 13-butadiene. The rearrangement can take place via a carbocation intermediate formed on a Brnsted acid site, or through an adsorbed species on the active phase of the dehydrogenation catalyst. (62-64) By increasing the temperature, the rates of both CH and CC cleavage reactions are increased, and therefore temperature and pressure must be carefully controlled to achieve an optimal olefin yield. In short, the balance between dehydrogenation and these side reactions is very complex.
Fortunately, these side reactions are catalyzed by specific sites that are not required for dehydrogenation, which means that high olefin yields can be obtained by careful catalyst design. For instance, cracking reactions are efficiently catalyzed by Brnsted acid sites, while large Pt ensembles also display activity for hydrogenolysis, cracking, and isomerization reactions. Scheme 1 shows an overview of the side reactions that may be catalyzed by Brnsted acid and Pt sites on a typical Pt-based dehydrogenation catalyst. (26)
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Examples of the Side Reactions That May Occur When 1-Butene Is Exposed to a Pt/Al2O3 Catalyst: (1) Hydrogenolysis, (2) Thermal Cracking, (3) Catalytic Cracking, and (4) Isomerization
An additional problem is that the high temperatures required to obtain high olefin yields are also optimal conditions for the formation of coke. Consequently, the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts progressively deteriorates with time-on-stream, making it necessary to regenerate the catalysts frequently to preserve sufficient activity. This is particularly important when the process operates at high alkane conversions, due to the fact that polymerized olefins are believed to be coke precursors, as will be discussed in more detail in section 5.1. Hence, during the selection of the operational conditions in any industrial dehydrogenation process, a compromise must be struck between olefin selectivity and paraffin conversion.
Notably, the reaction equilibrium can be shifted to higher paraffin conversions by reducing the partial pressure of the paraffin or by withdrawing the hydrogen produced. As was shown in the previous section, two strategies have been adopted in industry to lower paraffin partial pressure, reducing the pressure below atmospheric (Catofin) or diluting the paraffin feed with steam (STAR process). (26, 30) Hydrogen can be removed from the reaction medium by selective hydrogen combustion (SHC), which involves the addition of an oxidant to the reaction feed to burn off the hydrogen formed during dehydrogenation. Relatively mild oxidants, for example, CO2, are preferred, as the use of strong oxidants, like O2, risks also combusting the hydrocarbon reactants and products. Through this approach, a considerable amount of heat is generated, which promotes the endothermic dehydrogenation reaction. Another method deals with the addition of a solid oxygen carrier (such as ceria) that serves as a source of oxygen for oxidizing the hydrogen formed. The reduced ceria is reoxidized during the regeneration step. (65) Another strategy is to use a membrane permeable to hydrogen to withdraw the latter from the system, thereby shifting the equilibrium toward higher olefin yields. Nevertheless, as the thermal stability of these membranes is limited, this approach is more suited for the dehydrogenation of isobutene. (66-68)
The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of paraffins is related to SHC by the fact that an oxidant is also added to the feed, although in ODH the latter is done to directly oxidize the paraffin to the respective olefin. ODH has some advantages that make it a very attractive alternative to nonoxidative dehydrogenation, including the facts that the reaction is exothermic (propane ODH: ΔH2980 = 117 kJ mol1) and not equilibrium limited. However, a good control of side reactions, such as cracking and the excessive oxidation of reaction products, is very challenging.
4 Overview of Nonoxidative Dehydrogenation Catalyst Materials
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
As mentioned above, two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts. Although Pt represents the only precious metal that has been extensively studied, various metal oxides have been successfully tested, CrOx being the most prominent example due to its industrial use. Furthermore, promising results have been obtained using gallium, indium, vanadium, zinc, and molybdenum oxides. These materials are discussed in detail hereinafter.
4.1 Platinum-Based Catalysts
In the 1960s, a new technology was developed for the synthesis of the long-chain linear olefins used in the production of biodegradable detergents. (26) This new approach was inspired by the well-known bifunctional supported metal catalysts utilized in catalytic reforming, where a noble metal catalyzes hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions and the acidic support provides the active sites needed for isomerization, cyclization, and hydrocracking reactions. In contrast, dehydrogenation catalysts are monofunctional, as the acidic function must be minimized to avoid side reactions.
Albeit all of the noble metals of group VIIIB are active in the nonoxidative hydrogenation of alkanes, Pt is the only noble metal utilized in commercial applications due to its superior activation of paraffinic CH bonds and low activity to CC cleavage. The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968. On the basis of an alumina-supported platinum catalyst, the process greatly contributed to the widespread use of linear olefins in the detergent industry. In the early 1970s, UOP developed the Oleflex process, which was initially applied for the production of butadiene and later extended to propylene.

4.1.1 Nature of the Active Sites
Noble metals are active for dehydrogenation in the metallic state, and in some cases a reduction step is necessary prior to reaction. The dehydrogenation reaction of light alkanes is insensitive to the structure of the platinum particles; that is, such reactions are independent of the platinum particle size or crystallographic plane exposed. As only the amount of active sites is relevant, small particles are preferred. However, undesired side reactions that occur during alkane dehydrogenation, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coke formation, are sensitive to the structure of the platinum particles, although there is no general consensus regarding the effect of dispersion on the rate of these reactions. Some studies stress the markedly inverse relationship between particle size and the rate of hydrogenolysis (see Figure 9), the latter reaction being one of the main causes of coke formation. (69-72) Contrarily, others believe that for hydrogenolysis to take place, carbon deposits need to be in the vicinity of adsorbed hydrogen, which is more likely to occur on large Pt ensembles than on small particles. (37, 73, 74)
DFT calculations have been utilized to calculate the energy barrier of propane dehydrogenation on flat (111) and stepped (211) Pt crystal planes by Yang et al. (72) Indeed, it was found that step sites are more reactive, as the energy barrier to form propylene is much lower on step sites (2434 kJ mol1) than on the flat surface (6372 kJ mol1). Nevertheless, propane adsorbs more strongly on the latter, forming propylidyne intermediates believed to serve as precursors for both hydrogenolysis and coke formation. (72, 75)
4.1.2 Catalyst Deactivation
Two main processes cause the deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. First and foremost, the side reactions that form carbon deposits on the catalyst surface lead to the coverage of the active sites with coke, which results in a drop in activity. As it is not possible to completely prevent coke deposition, the catalyst needs to be regenerated frequently by combusting the coke deposits. However, the high temperature of both the regeneration process and the dehydrogenation reaction triggers the agglomeration or sintering of the platinum nanoparticles, the concomitant loss in active sites also resulting in catalyst deactivation. In addition to temperature, the composition of the reaction mixture has a profound influence on the sintering behavior of supported Pt catalysts. As early as 1977, Fiedorow et al. showed that Pt/Al2O3 catalysts more readily sinter in an oxygen-containing atmosphere than in a hydrogen-containing atmosphere at temperatures above 600 C. (76, 77) A third important factor determining catalyst sintering is the interaction between Pt and the catalyst support. Nagai et al. reported that Pt on Al2O3 readily sinters after treatment in air at 800 C, while Pt on CeO2 remains stable due to the strong interaction between ceria and Pt. The authors proposed that the strength of the Ptsupport interaction depends on the strength of the PtOM bond (where M represents the cation in the support), which in turn shows an excellent correlation with the electron density of the oxygen in the support. As a result, the authors conclude the electron density of oxygen in the support in effect controls the sintering of supported Pt particles. (78)
However, Pt can be redispersed on the catalyst by the addition of low amounts of oxygen and chlorine in the feed at temperatures around 500 C, although this process can only occur when the interaction between the support and the PtOx and PtOxCly species formed is such that mobile surface complexes are produced. (76, 79-83)

4.1.3 Role of the Support
Good supports for dehydrogenation of alkanes have to be thermally stable, especially under the harsh hydrothermal conditions that the material experiences during the regeneration step. In addition, limited support acidity is needed to avoid undesirable side reactions, such as coke formation and alkane isomerization. Finally, for an optimal distribution of the metallic particles, a relatively large surface area and uniform pore size distribution are preferred. (85)
High surface area alumina is the classical support employed in platinum-based dehydrogenation catalysts due to its high thermal stability, mechanical strength, and its exceptional ability of maintaining the platinum nanoparticles dispersed, which is crucial to attain stable catalyst performance. However, most alumina supports are acidic, and therefore promoters are used to curb support acidity. The addition of alkaline metals, such as Li, Na, and K, poisons these acid sites, suppressing the formation of coke on the support as shown in Figure 10. (84, 86-89) Moreover, these promoters can modify the properties of the platinum and suppress side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis and isomerization, reportedly due to a reduction in the effective size of platinum clusters. (69-72) Zn and Mg have also been used to dope the support, because the resulting spinel phase is less acidic and thermally more stable. These spinels also curtail the sintering of platinum due to a strong metalsupport interaction. (90-93) Yet another strategy is to use more stable polymorphs of alumina, such as θ- or α-alumina, because the latter have considerably less Brnsted acid sites relative to γ-alumina, albeit they also tend to have considerably lower surface areas. It is also important to mention that to reach a high dispersion of Pt on the support, Lewis acid sites and amphoteric OH groups are required (which limits the use of SiO2 and basic supports, such as MgO or ZnO). Indeed, by hydrothermally treating γ-Al2O3 prior to impregnation, the formation of additional hydroxyl groups results in a better Pt dispersion after impregnation and calcination. (94)
Zeolites are a commonly used alternative support for dehydrogenation catalysts. Dumesic and co-workers reported PtSn supported on zeolite K-L to be a highly active, selective, and stable catalyst in the selective dehydrogenation of isobutane. (95-98) The authors suggest that in the presence of K, zeolite L can stabilize small PtSn particles in the micropores of the support. In addition, this catalyst shows a high tolerance to coke deposition. This is particularly important as the strong acid sites of zeolites make them very susceptible to coking. (85) Recently, Azzam et al. studied how the structure of zeolite L affected the stability of a Pt/K-L catalyst during the dehydrogenation of propane. (99) Using kinetic isotope experiments, they found no evidence of isotopic scrambling, suggesting that the dehydrogenation reaction was irreversible in this system. Furthermore, the steric restraints of the zeolite structure do not prevent coke formation via bimolecular reactions, in contrast to what was observed for hexane aromatization. (100, 101) Iglesia et al. found Pt supported on Na[Fe]ZSM-5 zeolites to be highly selective and stable catalysts in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. (102) These authors claim that the replacement of the framework Al3+ for Fe3+ ions is essential for the Pt precursor to anchor inside the 10-member ring zeolite channels, which in turn is necessary to obtain subnanometric Pt clusters after reduction. The resulting catalyst displays high stability and selectivity toward light olefins, which is explained by the low acidity of the zeolitic support. Further modifications of the catalyst involving the neutralization of the residual acid sites with Cs after Pt reduction improved the selectivity of the catalyst in the dehydrogenation of n-pentane and n-heptane. (103) On the other hand, SBA-15 (a mesoporous silica) was found to be an unsuitable support, as the PtSn nanoparticles readily sinter due to the weak metalsupport interaction. (85)
4.1.4 Role of the Promoters
Despite the fact that platinum-based catalysts display very high activity in dehydrogenation reactions, their intrinsic selectivity to alkenes and catalyst stability are not entirely satisfactory. Consequently, the addition of promoters, which are able to modify the catalytic properties of platinum, is necessary to obtain an optimal catalyst. Tin is by far the most studied promoter, and all of the platinum-based catalyst formulations that are industrially applied include this post-transition metal, the addition of which modifies both the platinum active phase and the support. Essentially, Sn suppresses hydrogenolysis and isomerization reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes the acidity of the support, and facilitates the diffusion of the coke species from the metal surface to the support. Although these beneficial effects of tin promotion are well-known and have been amply described in the literature, the working principles of the PtSn system are still under debate. Indeed, both geometric and electronic effects have been invoked to explain the mechanism through which tin influences the catalytic properties of platinum. In any case, it is clear that SnO2 species present on the catalyst are reduced by the hydrocarbon feed during the dehydrogenation reaction and/or during a prereduction step, yielding a PtSn alloy. The reducibility of SnO2 depends largely on the interaction with the support, strong interaction making the reduction more difficult. However, Pt in close proximity assists with the reduction of Sn. (85)
From the geometric point of view, it has been suggested that isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and the formation of coke precursors can all be suppressed by reducing the size of platinum nanoparticles. (97, 98, 104, 105) Notably, the formation of a platinumtin alloy and/or the partial covering of the platinum particles by tin species results in the creation of smaller platinum ensembles. Olsbye et al. have suggested that tin selectively covers low coordination platinum sites (such as steps, corners, edges, and defects), which they believe are responsible for the hydrogenolysis reaction. (106, 107) Furthermore, the so-called ensemble effect can be employed to explain the geometric advantages of Sn addition to Pt-based catalysts. Dehydrogenation is believed to be a structure-insensitive reaction, meaning that very small groups or even single Pt atoms can catalyze the reaction. On the other hand, side reactions, such as coking, are structure-sensitive, and require relatively large ensembles of Pt. PtSn alloy formation effectively reduces the amount of neighboring Pt atoms within the ensembles, curbing these structure-sensitive reactions. Moreover, it has been suggested that the sintering of Pt nanoparticles is retarded with the addition of Sn. (107) Additionally, coke precursors prefer to adsorb on large Pt ensembles, and thus the addition of Sn facilitates the migration of these precursors from the PtSn surface to the support, effectively reducing the detrimental effects of coke deposition. (104, 108)
A secondary effect of Sn addition is the modification of the electronic properties of platinum. Alloyed metallic Sn or Sn2+ species in close contact with platinum are able to transfer electrons to the 5d band of platinum atoms, which alters the adsorptive and catalytic properties of the metal. The interaction of promoters with platinum can be assessed by measuring the heat of adsorption of distinct probe molecules through microcalorimetric methods. (109-114) Dumesic et al. performed a thorough adsorption microcalorimetry study and observed that the heat of ethylene and isobutene adsorption decreases with the addition of tin. (115-117) Infrared spectroscopy revealed that during the adsorption of ethylene, tin suppresses the formation of ethylidyne species and weakens the molecular adsorption of ethylene on the platinum surface. Additional DFT calculations explained these experimental results by revealing an increase in the electron density of platinum, which weakens the adsorption of ethylidyne on platinum atoms in close contact with tin. As discussed in section 5.1, ethylidyne is suspected to be an important precursor of coke and hydrogenolysis. Furthermore, DFT calculations described in Figure 28 revealed that Sn promotion significantly reduces the dehydrogenation reaction rate of platinum catalysts, as the energy barrier of the dissociative adsorption of propane is increased. On the other hand, the selectivity is increased as the energy barrier for the desorption of propylene drops, making deep dehydrogenation and cracking reactions less likely. (114, 118, 119) The balance between these two effects results in an optimum ratio of Pt and Sn, which these calculations suggest is Pt3Sn. On the basis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) observations, Siri et al. reported an increase of the electron density of platinum when tin was incorporated to silica and γ-alumina-supported catalysts. (120) DFT calculations have shown that the addition of Sn also reduces the heat of adsorption of hydrogen on the PtSn (111) surface, which suggests that the diffusion of hydrogen atoms is more facile on the latter than on a Pt (111) surface. (73, 121) Figure 11 illustrates the important role that the electronic modification of Pt by Sn is believed to play in inhibiting coke formation. The left part of the figure shows high energy resolution fluorescence detection X-ray absorption near edge structure (HERFD-XANES) intensity contour maps of the Pt L-edge of catalysts comprising alumina-supported Pt (top) and PtSn (bottom). The right part of the figure shows a graphical interpretation of the XANES spectra, which illustrates the size of the metallic nanoparticles in both catalysts increasing during the regeneration step, an effect that is more severe for Pt/Al2O3. A shift to higher energies in the XANES spectra during the reduction step reveals that Pt becomes more electronegative, which is attributed to the formation of the PtSn alloy. This phenomenon, which is triggered by the partial reduction of the SnO2 present on the support, is reversed during the oxidation step. (122) Sn enrichment of the Pt nanoparticles may be a problem, as the Pt3Sn alloy is believed to be significantly more active for the dehydrogenation reaction than the PtSn alloy. (114, 123) Summarizing, Figure 12 shows an artist impression of a PtSn nanoparticle on alumina.

The surface of the alumina is covered with SnO2, which gets reduced when in close proximity to Pt and incorporated into a bimetallic PtSn nanoparticle. Surface Pt atoms catalyze the dehydrogenation reaction according to the mechanism shown in the inset.
Other metals have been studied as promoters of the activity of platinum in the dehydrogenation of alkanes. Most notably, zinc prevents undesired side reaction such as coke formation and isomerization in a fashion similar to that of tin. (124-129) GaOx and InOx dopants are used to hinder side reactions by the poisoning of surface Brnsted acid sites, while the formation of PtGa and PtIn alloys has both a geometric and an electronic effect on the Pt nanoparticles, decreasing coke deposition further. (130-133) Another alloy that has been investigated is PtGe, which is believed to function in a way analogous to that of PtSn, although the electronic effect is believed to be weaker. (134)
An overview of the Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts discussed above, including relevant reaction parameters, such as conversion, selectivity, temperature, space velocity, and feed composition, is given in Table 3. The activity of the catalysts is compared using their calculated specific activity, which is defined as the moles of olefin formed per mol of Pt per second at the start of the dehydrogenation reaction. As mentioned before, the dehydrogenation reaction is insensitive to the structure of the Pt, so all Pt atoms present at the surface of the catalyst nanoparticles can be assumed to participate equally in the dehydrogenation reaction. However, it was not possible to calculate turnover frequency (TOF) due to the fact that Pt dispersion values (the ratio between the Pt at the surface versus the interior of the catalyst nanoparticles) were not forthcoming in most of the references included in Table 3. Finally, as a proxy for catalyst stability, we have determined the deactivation rate (rd), for which we assume a first-order deactivation mechanism: (135)

4.2 Chromium Oxide-Based Catalysts
Chromium oxide-based catalysts have been one of the most actively investigated formulations since Frey and Huppke first reported the dehydrogenation activity of Cr2O3 in 1933. (143) During the 1940s, catalysts comprising chromia supported on alumina were used by UOP to industrially dehydrogenate butane to produce butene, which were dimerized and hydrogenated to form high-octane aviation fuels. These catalysts have been applied to several processes for the dehydrogenation of light olefins henceforth. (26) Given the industrial relevance of formulations comprising chromium oxide, their structure under different reaction conditions, the nature of the active sites, the role of the support, the effect of alkali metals promoters, and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction over these catalysts have all been intensively studied.
4.2.1 Nature of the Active Sites
Because the adsorption of paraffin molecules takes place on CrO sites, understanding the exact nature of these species under dehydrogenation reaction conditions is critically important. (144) On freshly prepared catalysts a number of surface species, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+ and Cr2+, have been identified. Furthermore, chromates, polychromates, crystalline α-chromia and amorphous chromia have been identified through a variety of techniques. (145-148) The relative concentration of these species seems to be dependent on a number of factors, such as chromium loading (relative to the surface area), the calcination treatment used during catalyst preparation, and the support employed. This is illustrated in Figure 13, where chromium species deposited on SBA-15 (a mesoporous silica) and alumina are compared by Raman spectroscopy. Different species are observed depending on the Cr loading: at low loadings isolated CrO42 species predominate, while at higher concentrations CrOCr species become prevalent due to the formation of Cr2O3 crystallites. These crystallites are more readily formed on SBA-15 than on alumina, as the interaction between chromium oxide and SBA-15 is relatively weak.

In the right set of graphs, the relative change of bands (BD) corresponding to Cr3+ and Cr6+ is shown. Both graphs illustrate that Cr3+ (band at 700 nm) is formed at the expense of Cr6+ (bands at 260 and 370 nm) during PDH. Reprinted from ref 150, copyright 2011, with permission from Elsevier.
Prior to the 1990s, the study of the structure of chromium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts had been restricted to conditions far removed from those found under real operation. For this catalytic system, this represented a great limitation, as the reaction mixtures are believed to reduce chromium oxide species. The development of in situ spectroscopic techniques made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. As is shown in Figure 14 with XANES and in Figure 15 with UVvis spectroscopy, it was observed that surface Cr3+ species are produced at the expense of Cr6+ species during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction and that polychromate is more easily reduced than monochromate. (151-153) Consequently, Cr3+, coordinatively unsaturated Cr2+, as well as a mixture of both Cr3+ and Cr2+ have been all proposed as the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. (154-157) Cr6+ or Cr5+ have not been observed to be active for the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit Cr6+/Cr5+ species do appear to be the precursor of active Cr3+ sites. This has been assigned to the fact that reduction of Cr5+ species leads to the formation of monomeric Cr3+ active sites. Indeed, it has been observed that Cr5+ species that are not reduced in a hydrogen atmosphere can be reduced by alkanes. (150, 158-161)
With respect to coordination, it appears that Cr3+ sites need to be coordinatively unsaturated to show catalytic activity. (162) Indeed, a semiquantitative relationship has been found between the amount of pseudo-octahedral Cr3+ formed during reduction and the dehydrogenation activity shown by the catalyst. (152, 153) Furthermore, it has been observed that isolated Cr3+ species with two coordinative vacancies are formed on CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of an alkane. Thus, it appears that these catalysts contain coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ under reaction conditions. Experiments performed with Cr loadings above monolayer coverage, which have been shown to include crystalline chromia clusters, suggest that bulk Cr3+ ions in a perfect octahedral environment are inactive toward alkane dehydrogenation. Admittedly, these fully coordinated Cr3+ species are highly stable, whereas coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species would try to attain the stability of bulk Cr3+ ions by adsorbing alkane molecules from the gas phase.
Figure 16
Figure 16. Yield of butenes at 540 C over a chromiaalumina catalyst as a function of Cr loading. Activity increases linearly with Cr loading, even above monolayer coverage. However, the yield drops once Cr2O3 crystallites start being detected via XRD. Reprinted from ref 163, copyright 2000, with permission from Elsevier.
With respect to nuclearity, the need for a highly dispersed active phase is highlighted by the fact that, while activity first rises with increasing chromium loading, a drop in activity is observed when the loading is such that crystalline Cr2O3 starts forming, as illustrated in Figure 16. (163-165) The fact that activity and Cr loading hold an almost linear relationship below monolayer coverage suggests that both isolated and clustered Cr3+ centers are catalytically active. Actually, three different types of Cr3+ ions have been spectroscopically detected at these loadings: (1) Cr3+ species formed by reduction of surface Cr6+/Cr5+ ions; (2) isolated centers of Cr3+ ions stabilized by the alumina surface; and (3) small amorphous (and thus XRD invisible) Cr3+ clusters. (29, 49) Determining the individual contributions of these species to catalytic performance has proven to be extremely challenging. Some studies correlating dehydrogenation activity with Cr-speciation suggested that a vast majority of catalytic activity can be ascribed to the dispersed Cr3+ phase, the role of the other phases being the replenishment of the depleted Cr3+ surface phase during long runs. (152, 153, 166) More detailed studies involving the calculation of turnover frequencies (TOF) have led some workers to propose that multinuclear Cr3+ sites are more active than isolated Cr3+ ions, a proposition that finds both support and dissent in the literature. (147, 160, 163, 167-169) Kumar et al. observed that when γ-alumina was employed as the catalyst support, oligomeric chromium oxide species would display the highest activity and selectivity. However, when SBA-15 was used as the carrier, isolated chromia species with coordination number larger than 4 showed the highest activity. (149) It is clear that the optimal nuclearity of active Cr3+ sites remains a topic still under debate.
Albeit selectivity has been found to be insensitive to chromium loading, it does change over time. (170) At first, the selectivity toward alkenes is fairly low and the catalyst produces mainly carbon oxides, as is shown in Figure 17. This is attributed to the fact that during this induction period, highly oxidized, and thus catalytically inactive, chromium species are being reduced to active chromium species with lower oxidation states. Eventually, a high selectivity of 93.6% can be reached at a conversion of 55%. (29)
To summarize, in recent years dehydrogenation activity has been mostly assigned to Cr3+ species that are both dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated. Thus, it seems that active sites need to fulfill oxidation state, coordination, and nuclearity requirements. In fact, these and other factors, such as the origin of Cr3+ species, have been used by some workers to classify the catalytically active sites. (171-173)
It should also be mentioned that many other factors could also influence the activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts. For instance, the addition of CO2 as a mild oxidant is known to improve the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts by removing the evolved hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction, which effectively shifts the equilibrium toward product formation. (174-176) At the same time, CO2 is ineffective at oxidizing catalytically active Cr3+ species to catalytically inactive Cr5+ or Cr6+ species. (150, 177, 178)
To obtain high activity, the operating conditions also need to be considered, because activity is directly proportional to both the reaction temperature and the partial pressure of the alkane. Moreover, alkane conversion has been found to be inversely proportional to space velocity, and selectivity has been found to be directly proportional to alkene selectivity. In studies where Cr/Al2O3 catalysts were used in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, it was found that when the space velocity (GHSV) decreased from 3600 to 600 h1, ethane conversion increased from 27.6% to 31.4%, while selectivity to ethylene decreased from 91.7% to 64.9%. (179) This effect has been attributed to the fact that lower space velocities favor ethane activation as well as methane and coke formation.
In conclusion, it is possible to achieve high activity and selectivity over Cr-based hydrogenation catalysts by adjusting the composition of the catalysts and/or the operating conditions.

Conversion drops over time, while the selectivity remains stable after increasing during the initial stages of the reaction. To the right, the mass uptake of the catalyst as measured by a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) is shown as a function of time-on-stream. Over the first 40 min, the catalyst mass increases due to coke deposition, after which it remains stable. Reproduced from ref 180, with permission from the PCCP Owner Societies.
4.2.2 Catalyst Deactivation
Over the course of a catalytic cycle, CrOx dehydrogenation catalysts lose their activity due to the deposition of coke, and as is the case with Pt-based catalysts, they need to be periodically regenerated. Experiments performed using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), shown in Figure 17, revealed that the weight of the catalyst increases during the initial stages (1040 min) of the reaction, no additional carbon being deposited after this time. However, conversion continues to drop beyond this point, which indicates that the carbon originally deposited becomes more detrimental for the catalytic activity over time. Although the catalysts recover most of their activity after each reactionregeneration cycle, the loss of activity is not entirely reversible. Indeed, the heat released through the combustion of coke during regeneration leads to the incorporation of chromia into the alumina framework, which causes the amount of catalytically active Cr species to decrease with each regeneration step. (29) This phenomenon has been measured by UVvis spectroscopy, as shown in Figure 18. In the figure, a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is treated at 1100 C for 12 h, which results in the bands corresponding to Cr3+ species to shift, signaling the incorporation of Cr3+ species into the alumina support. Consequently, the dehydrogenation activity shown by the catalyst drops, and an almost linear relationship has been found between activity and the amount of Cr6+ species on the catalyst surface (as measured after the regeneration step). (150, 166, 181)
Figure 18
Figure 18. Top graph shows the ex situ diffuse reflectance UVvis spectra of both fresh and deactivated CrOx/Al2O3. The bottom left graph shows the extent of the shift for the bands at 600 and 450 nm, which correspond to the first and second dd transitions, respectively. The bottom right graph shows that the fraction of Cr3+ incorporated into the alumina framework is strongly dependent on the calcination temperature. Reprinted from ref 49 (top graph), copyright 2004, and ref 172 (bottom two graphs), copyright 2002, both with permission from Elsevier.
Two processes are believed to lead to the dissolution of Cr3+ into the Al2O3 carrier and result in catalytically inactive Cr3+ species. First, the sintering of the alumina may cause entrapment of the Cr species inside the bulk of the support. As an additional effect, the loss of alumina surface area reduces the ability of the support to stabilize Cr6+ species formed during the regeneration step. (154, 182) Consequently, Cr3+ ions migrate into the support. Indeed, it is believed that the similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, which produces a type of chromiaalumina spinel that is inactive for the dehydrogenation reaction. (145, 183) Of note is the fact that in the presence of γ-alumina, entrapment is believed to be the dominant process, while in its absence migration is favored. (145, 183)
At elevated temperatures, γ-alumina undergoes a thermodynamically driven transformation to θ- or even α-alumina, which coincides with a considerable loss in surface area. It is unknown whether the presence of chromia facilitates or hinders the sintering of the alumina support, as some authors have found the presence of chromia to enhance sintering, while other research groups have observed the opposite. (172, 184-186) The transformation of γ-alumina to α-alumina can be restrained by doping the support with silica, zirconia, magnesia, or lanthana. For example, Wachowski et al. observed that when a small amount of La2O3 is added to Al2O3, the transition of θ-alumina to α-alumina occurs at a temperature 136 C higher relative to when no lanthana is added. (187, 188) The authors found that the use of cations having ionic radius larger than Al3+, which tend not to dissolve in Al2O3, in combination with a preparation method capable of affording high dopant dispersion, is most effective in preventing the formation of α-alumina.
It is important to note that the advantages offered by the combustion of coke during the regeneration step far outweigh these unwanted side effects. First and foremost, the heat released in this step is harnessed to fuel the dehydrogenation reaction, making coke deposition not completely undesirable. Furthermore, oxidation of Cr3+ to Cr6+ during regeneration also accomplishes the redispersion of chromia crystallites. The latter is particularly important, given that the sintering of chromia under dehydrogenation conditions has also been reported to be a contributing factor to the reversible deactivation of chromium-based catalysts. (171, 172)
Another interesting example of a deactivation phenomenon caused by a change in surface composition related to the nature of the support has been observed on catalysts comprising mesoporous silica as carrier. Indeed, by analyzing this material via XPS before and after 6 h of time-on-stream, an important amount of Cr3+ species was found to be reduced to Cr2+ by the hydrogen evolved during the anoxic dehydrogenation reaction. In turn, the resulting Cr2+ species were found to be inactive in dehydrogenation.
4.2.3 Role of the Support
The nature of the support is important not only because it governs the mechanical properties of the catalyst, but also because the interaction of the carrier with the active phase can have a profound impact on catalyst activity and selectivity. Alumina is by far the most common support, and a variety of methods to produce chromiaalumina catalysts have been investigated. These include the incipient wetness impregnation of alumina with CrO3 or Cr(NO3)3 solutions (if an alkali ion is added, an aqueous solution of its chromate salt is used), the coprecipitation of Al(OH)3 and Cr(OH)3 from Al3+ and Cr3+ solutions, a type of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) involving volatile chromium compounds being deposited on alumina called atomic layer deposition, and the decomposition of complexes including both alumina and chromium. All of these methods are followed by a calcination step at approximately 600 C. Increasing the calcination temperature above 600 C causes a loss of dehydrogenation activity, probably due to the incorporation of Cr into the Al2O3 framework, as discussed in the preceding section. (182) Very recently, an interesting synthesis strategy for preparing a mesoporous CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst by using a Cr-containing metalorganic-framework filled with an alumina precursor and subsequently combusting the organic material was reported. The resulting catalyst shows excellent thermal stability and is very active for isobutene dehydrogenation. (189) Interestingly, increasing the pretreatment temperature of the alumina support has a positive effect on the TOF shown by the resulting catalyst, which has been attributed to an increase in the number of multinuclear Cr3+ sites. (172) In addition, this pretreatment will result in a more stable Al2O3 polymorph, which is less likely to sinter. However, the use of alumina as support is not free of drawbacks. For instance, Al2O3 can catalyze cracking and coking due to its surface acidity, which leads to a drop in both activity and selectivity. A solution for this is the doping of alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions, which can effectively poison these undesirable acid sites.
The use of zirconia as an alternative support has also been investigated. Indeed, the low surface acidity of this oxide and the fact that chromia imparts an enhanced sintering resistance to ZrO2 make the latter a viable substitute for alumina. (159, 160) De Rossi et al. have reported that catalysts with zirconia as the support are more active in the dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane than the corresponding catalysts supported on silica or alumina. (167, 168, 181, 190) This has been attributed to an increase in the amount of surface Cr5+ that is produced during the regeneration of Cr2O3/ZrO2. The latter improves activity because Cr5+ forms catalytically active mononuclear Cr3+ under reaction conditions, as has already been mentioned. In turn, the high amount of Cr5+ on this catalyst has been attributed to the strong interaction between chromia and the basic support. (170) The choice of zirconia over alumina as the catalyst support offers the additional advantage of preventing the formation of CrAl mixed oxides. Nevertheless, Cr2O3/ZrO2 has been observed to deactivate faster than other less active catalysts including Cr2O3/Al2O3, which has been partially imputed to the higher coking rate displayed by Cr2O3/ZrO2. Additionally, XPS studies suggest that chromiazirconia catalysts also favor the formation of chromium carbides, which are inactive in dehydrogenation and consequently cause catalyst deactivation. (170)
De Rossi and co-workers have also concluded that albeit Cr/ZrO2 catalysts can outperform their alumina- and silica-supported counterparts, zirconia-supported formulations could be further improved by increasing the surface area and the thermal stability of Cr2O3/ZrO2. This has inspired other workers to produce chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts with high surface areas and highly dispersed active sites. For example, Fujdala and Tilley have reported the use of a cothermolysis method involving several thermolytic molecular precursors to produce a Cr/Si/Zr/O catalyst capable of showing propane conversions greater than 35% and propylene selectivities exceeding 90% at 450 C. (191) According to the authors, the aforementioned values are among the best reported in the literature, particularly at such a low temperature. Korhonen et al. attempted to combine the high surface area of alumina with the basic nature of zirconia by covering an alumina support with a zirconia layer. (192) However, the resulting CrOx/Al2O3ZrO2 catalyst displayed inferior activity as compared to the benchmark CrOx/ZrO2 catalyst.
The use of silica as the support in chromia-based dehydrogenation catalysts requires a relative high surface area to stabilize Cr6+ sites. (193) Surface area considerations also explain the fact that titania does not constitute a good support, as CrOx easily sinters due to its weak interaction with TiO2. However, an active and stable propane dehydrogenation catalyst has been obtained by preparing a titania mesoporous material with Cr dopants. (177)

Figure 19. TPR profiles of 6 wt % CrOx on different supports. The catalysts with a strong reduction peak at low temperatures show the highest catalytic activity. The figure is reproduced from ref. 179 with kind permission from Springer Science and Business Media.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) results suggest that there is a direct relationship between catalytic activity and the reducibility of the catalysts (see Figure 19). (179) Indeed, studies on the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane have revealed that catalytic activity based on ethane conversion and ethylene yields follows the order CrOx/γ-Al2O3 > CrOx/SiO2 > CrOx/MCM-41  CrOx/MgO  CrOx/Si-2 (Si-2 is the abbreviation of silicalite-2 zeolite, which has been described as a silica analogue of the aluminosilicate zeolite ZSM-11 (194)), a reverse order being found for the reduction temperature of the chromium species on the aforementioned catalyst supports.
CrMgAl and CrMg mixed oxides prepared using layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors have been studied as catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. (195) Some of these catalysts were found to achieve ethane conversions of 2730% and selectivity toward ethylene of 7175%. The method used for introducing Cr into the LDH precursors was found to determine several properties of the resulting mixed oxides, such as surface area, catalytic performance, coking resistance, and thermal stability against sintering.
Finally, the study of porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials has been particularly informative with regards to the influence that acidity has on catalytic behavior. In the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane, catalysts based on these materials display an initial conversion of 18.1% with a selectivity toward propylene of 87.1% at 550 C. (162) Interestingly, it has been observed that while the selectivity of this material toward cracking decreases with time-on-stream, its selectivity toward the alkene tends to remain constant. The latter has been explained by assigning the occurrence of cracking and dehydrogenation reactions to strong and medium strength acid sites, respectively. The authors argue that strong acid sites are rapidly deactivated, inhibiting cracking reactions and favoring the production of the alkene.
4.2.4 Role of the Promoters
Alkali metals, such as K, Rb, and Cs, are known to promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts. This phenomenon has been attributed to the ability of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, to reduce surface acidity, and/or to increase the number of active chromium sites. (154, 189) Additionally, the presence of alkali metal promoters increases the dispersion of the active phase by assisting the formation under oxidizing conditions of Cr6+ complexes that subsequently give rise to Cr3+ under a reducing atmosphere.
A notable exception to this promotion effect has been found in the doping with K+ of several PDH catalysts, such as chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, galliumchromium mixed oxides pillared α-zirconium phosphate, and chromia/zirconia. (162, 196) For these materials, doping with K+ results in a dramatic decrease in catalytic activity. According to some authors, this indicates that oxygen ions play an active role in the dissociative adsorption of propane and/or in the desorption of hydrogen. Indeed, these workers contend that in these catalysts, potassium forms bonds with oxygen anions, which causes some properties, such as the Lewis acidity and the coordinative unsaturation of the latter, to be altered in a way that hinders catalysis. (181, 190) A similar argument has been used to explain the drop in activity observed when doping chromia/zirconia catalysts with sodium, although this effect has not been observed for alumina-based formulations.

Note that partially reduced CrOx species are formed on the surface of the catalyst, and that the Cr is partially dissolved in the alumina support. The (simplified) reaction mechanism is shown in the inset.
An artists impression of a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is shown in Figure 20, while Table 4 offers an overview of the different CrOx catalysts used for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, as discussed in the previous section. As was the case in Table 3, in Tables 49 the activity of the catalysts is compared using their specific activity, as calculated according to the definition accompanying each table. The use of TOF was precluded by the fact that in oxide-based catalysts there exists a wide array of active species (e.g., monomers, oligomers, polymers, and crystalline species) exhibiting different degrees of catalytic activity and accessibility (some of these species are in the bulk as opposed to on the surface), which makes the determination of the actual number of active sites impossible.

4.3 Vanadium Oxide-Based Catalysts
Despite the excellent performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, a number of issues including catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr have spurred the search for alternatives. Vanadium oxides are known to be active for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including dehydrogenation. Research on vanadium-based dehydrogenation catalysts started in the 1980s, although at that time the focus was on oxidative dehydrogenation using vanadiummagnesium mixed oxides. (199, 200)
The nature of the vanadium present on the catalyst depends to a large extent on the type of carrier, the support surface area, the metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium. (201) Far below the theoretical monolayer coverage isolated vanadium species are present, at intermediate surface coverage polymeric species or sheets of vanadium oxide are favored, and above monolayer coverage V2O5 crystallites become dominant. Therefore, a combination of VO-support, VOV, or VO moieties may be obtained, each having different catalytic activity. In addition, depending on the support, mixed oxides with Al, Zr, Ti, or Mg may be formed.
The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings. On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts. On the other hand, acid sites are detrimental for catalyst performance, because they facilitate cracking and induce coke formation. A schematic display of these vanadium species is shown in Figure 21. (202)
Figure 21

Several authors claim that two-dimensional polymeric V3+ or V4+ species are the most active for dehydrogenation, (203-206) the vanadium species bonded directly with the γ/θ-alumina support being the most active sites in PDH. Isolated vanadium species are also active, albeit they are susceptible to deactivation due to coke formation. On the contrary, large V2O5 crystallites are practically inactive in dehydrogenation. (30, 206)
Prior to reaction, the vanadium in these catalysts is generally present as V5+. However, the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+. (207-209) The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds. Harlin et al. studied the effects of vanadium oxide reduction with H2, CO, and CH4 prior to the dehydrogenation reaction. In all cases, the reduction was incomplete, and yielded a mix of vanadium oxide species, including V3+, V4+, and V5+ (see Figure 22). Higher initial catalytic activities were obtained in all cases, although the effect was strongest after reduction with CO. The authors suggested that when the catalyst was reduced with H2 and CH4, detrimental OH groups were formed. V4+ was determined to be the most active species in butane dehydrogenation.

Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and to a lesser extent to coke deposition. When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4, both of which are less active. (206) V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C. (210)
In several studies, CO2 is added to the feed as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields. (211-213) Different reasons for this beneficial effect of CO2 have been suggested, such as the removal of acid sites that catalyze unwanted side reactions, coke gasification, oxidation of overly reduced vanadium centers, and hydrogen removal by the reverse watergas shift reaction. Ogonowski et al. reported that the effect of CO2 depends strongly on the catalyst support. Relatively weak basic sites on carriers, such as those present on an activated carbon support, facilitate the reverse water gas shift reaction, which lifts the thermodynamic limitation of the reaction and increases alkane conversion. When these basic sites are too strong, as is the case on Al2O3 and ZnO2, CO2 irreversibly adsorbs and poisons these sites. This increases the acidity of the support, which in turn increases coke formation and lowers selectivity. If these basic sites are absent, as in the case of SiO2, no beneficial effects of CO2 are observed.
Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity. (214) Furthermore, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide. According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation. (208)

4.4 Molybdenum Oxide-Based Catalysts
Molybdenum oxides are also frequently used as catalysts in hydrocarbon conversion reactions, including dehydrogenation. To our knowledge, the first report of the dehydrogenation activity of a molybdenum oxide-based catalyst was of MoO3/Al2O3 in the dehydrocyclization of n-heptane, which was published in 1946. (216) Since that first report, the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes on MoOx has been studied scarcely, as emphasis has been given to the study of oxidative dehydrogenation on these materials.
The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions. (217)
Harlin et al. noted that optimal activity was achieved with monolayer coverage of molybdenum oxide on an alumina support. In the fresh catalyst, molybdenum is present as Mo6+, but analogously to catalysts comprising vanadium and chromium oxide, MoO3 is reduced by the hydrocarbon feed during reaction to create the active species. (218) These reduced sites are believed to be Mo4+ and Mo5+. Further reduction results in sites that are more active, but the latter catalyze cracking and deactivate fast due to coke deposition. In fact, at loadings above monolayer coverage, the catalyst is more easily reduced, which results in a drop in catalyst activity. (218, 219) The same authors also point out that such a catalyst deactivates due to the formation of catalytically inactive Al2(MoO4)3 crystallites. To prevent the formation of this mixed oxide, they added magnesium oxide to obtain a molybdenummagnesium mixed oxide that also shows dehydrogenation activity. It was found that an additional beneficial effect of magnesia addition is that the resulting mixed oxide has lower acidity, which increases alkene selectivity and reduces coke deposition. The reduction of the catalyst with hydrogen prior to reaction increases conversion, although selectivity decreases due to the formation of acid sites. (220) Overall, MoO3 catalysts deactivate rapidly due to coking and generally afford a relatively low conversion and selectivity.
Figure 23
Figure 23. Yield of different carbon molecules during butane dehydrogenation on a MoOxCy catalyst at different steam partial pressures. When no steam is added, the selectivity to C4 alkenes drops rapidly and the methane yield reaches 100% after 5 h. The hydrogenolysis reaction is suppressed when steam is added to the feed. Reprinted from ref 221, copyright 1999, with permission from Elsevier.
The formation of molybdenum oxycarbides (MoOxCy) has been reported to occur during butane dehydrogenation on unsupported molybdenum oxide. These materials are also active in the dehydrogenation of paraffins, and a high activity close to the thermodynamic equilibrium is initially obtained, although over a period of a few hours the selectivity drops to zero and the reaction yields only methane, as shown in Figure 23. During this period, the oxycarbide becomes depleted from oxygen and a wide range of carbides active in hydrogenolysis are formed. (222) To improve the stability of the oxide, steam can be added to the feed (which hampers the growth of these carbides) or the catalyst can be doped with vanadium (which increases the oxophilicity of the catalyst). X-ray diffractograms showing this transition are shown in Figure 24. However, the introduction of steam is not free of drawbacks, as it induces sintering. Hydrogen addition prevents coke formation and increases conversion, albeit it is believed that H2 competitively adsorbs on the active sites of the catalyst. (221-223)
Figure 24

XRD diffractograms of the fresh Mo oxycarbide catalyst before dehydrogenation, but after pretreatment (top left), as well as after dehydrogenation reaction with no steam (top right), with 5 Torr of steam (bottom left), and with 18 Torr of steam (bottom right). In the absence of steam, the well-defined MoO2 and MoOxCy species disappear during reaction and are replaced by more amorphous MoOxCy species, which are enriched with carbon and presumably responsible for hydrogenolysis. The addition of steam prevents this transformation and with 18 Torr of steam, MoO2 and ordered MoOxCy species are still observed on the spent catalysts. Reprinted from ref 221, copyright 1999, with permission from Elsevier.
Consistent with the fact that MoOxCy is a catalyst active in butane dehydrogenation, Harlin et al. showed that MoO3 deposited on SiC displays significant catalytic properties when hydrogen and steam are present in the feed. (224) As compared to bulk MoO3 and MoO3 supported on SiO2 and Al2O3, higher selectivities and stability are obtained over MoO3/SiC, albeit at the cost of a lower conversion. This was explained by the increased reducibility of MoO3/SiC as compared to the MoO3/Al2O3 catalyst. A summary of the Mo-based catalysts used for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is shown in Table 6.

4.5 Gallium Oxide-Based Catalysts
The dehydrogenation activity of gallium oxide supported on ZSM-5, which was first reported in the late 1980s in studies dealing with conversion of propane to aromatics, has been the target of renewed attention in recent years. (225-228) In the interim, both bulk and supported Ga2O3 have been used as dehydrogenation catalysts.
The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate. Akin to Al2O3, Ga2O3 has different polymorphs of which β-Ga2O3 is not only the most stable, but also the most active Ga species in PDH according to some authors. (229) β-Ga2O3 has a monoclinic structure, in which gallium atoms are equally distributed between tetrahedral and octahedral configurations. This crystal structure has a high concentration of weak Lewis acid sites (coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral ones on the surface of the material), which are deemed to be centers of dehydrogenation activity. (230) Indeed, a heterolytic dissociation reaction mechanism has been proposed where H adsorbs on a Ga+ Lewis acid site and C3H7+ on a neighboring oxygen, although these species can also be adsorbed reversed. (33, 231) The assignment of Lewis acid sites as the active species was substantiated by Chen et al., (232) who, by relating the results of NH3-TPD measurements with activity data for different GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides, showed that a high concentration of Lewis acid groups in the form of coordinatively unsaturated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is a prerequisite for dehydrogenation activity (see Figure 25). Xu et al. reported dehydrogenation activity on both Lewis and Brnsted acid sites on GaO3/H-ZSM-5. A zeolitic support displaying a low concentration of medium and strong acid sites and a relatively high concentration of weak acid sites was found to lead to the most active and stable catalyst. (233, 234) In addition, Michorczyk et al. concluded that acidic groups catalyze the reaction after observing that promotion with a base, such as potassium, resulted in a decrease in activity. (235)

Several authors have performed DFT calculations in an effort to understand the dehydrogenation reaction mechanism on Ga2O3. Studies by Liu et al. regarding propane dehydrogenation on a perfect Ga2O3 (100) surface revealed that the CH bond is activated by a surface oxygen that abstracts an hydrogen from the propane molecule, thus forming a propyl species, which coordinates with a Ga surface site and a hydroxyl group. A second hydroxyl group is formed via β-hydrogen elimination, but for these hydroxyl groups to recombine, either as H2O or as H2, a high energy barrier needs to be overcome. This barrier is much lower over a gallium hydridehydroxide species, although the formation of the gallium hydride also involves a high energy barrier. Nevertheless, theoretical calculations by Pidko et al. indicate that these relatively stable [HGaOH]+ sites are preferentially regenerated by water desorption resulting in a reduced active site. (236) Murata and co-workers have observed an increase in activity after a prereduction step with hydrogen at 550 C, while a simultaneous increase of Gaδ+H and GaOH sites was observed via NH3 TPD. These authors proposed that these sites also form during reaction and may be responsible for the dehydrogenation activity of the silica supported Ga2O3 catalyst. (237, 238)
Contradictory information has been reported regarding the reducibility of Ga2O3. Rodriguez et al. reported that Ga2O3/Al2O3 is not reduced by hydrogen at 700 C, but the presence of Pd on the catalyst can assist the reduction of Ga3+ to Ga+ and Ga0 at temperatures between 300 and 550 C and form an alloy (in which Ga0 is immobilized). Indeed, it has been reported that the reduction of Ga2O3 can be promoted by the proximity of other, more easily reduced metals, such as Pt and Pd. (131-133, 238) For instance, on a PtGa/H-beta catalyst, reduced gallium hydrides were observed after hydrogen reduction at 550 C. (239) It has also been proposed that the reducibility of these species depends on the interaction of gallium oxide with the catalyst support, which is also the case with CrOx (vide supra), where a weak metalsupport interaction results in an increased reducibility. Indeed, Meitzner et al. showed that Ga2O3/H-ZSM-5 could be reduced by hydrogen or hydrocarbons at dehydrogenation reaction conditions. Finally, regarding the reduction of Ga2O3, it is important to note that Ga2O is gaseous and metallic gallium is liquid at dehydrogenation reaction conditions. (240)
A number of studies have shown that the addition of CO2 to the reactant feed improves the olefin yield. (241-245) Nakagawa et al. found that the addition of steam and CO2 decreased coke deposition on a Ga2O3/TiO2 catalyst by the Boudouart reaction, while also assisting ethylene desorption. (241, 242) However, other authors claimed that the increase in activity was caused by the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS). (243, 244) Additionally, Michorczyk et al. noted that this effect could only be seen at relative low levels of coke deposition. (235) It was suggested that CO2 could also poison the basic sites required for the dissociative adsorption of the alkane. Additionally, Hensen et al. studied the promoting effect of water with experiments and theory and observed an increase in the conversion of propane by cofeeding water. (246) The authors attributed this promoting effect to the formation of partially hydrolyzed gallium species, more specifically, to the formation of binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga3+ cations.
Different carriers have been used in gallium oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts, the inclusion of acid and basic sites on the support being important to achieve a high conversion. Xu et al. reported that in the absence of an oxidizing agent, the conversion obtained using Ga2O3 supported on ZrO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 was high, medium, and low, respectively, while SiO2 and MgO-supported Ga2O3 were inactive in alkane dehydrogenation. (233) The authors proposed the activity to be dependent on the presence of acid sites of medium strength on the catalyst surface. However, a different trend was observed when CO2 was present, as conversion was observed to be high on Ga2O3/TiO2 and low on Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3. This was attributed to the two contrary roles of CO2, which on the one hand removes H2 from the surface of the catalyst by the reverse watergas shift reaction, while on the other hand absorbs strongly on the basic sites of the support. Thus, the low conversion observed when zirconia or alumina were employed as the support can be ascribed to the relatively high amount of basic sites on these oxides. Notably, the structure of the support is also important, as a mesoporous GaAl mixed oxide exhibited an increased resistance to catalyst coking. (245)
Work on the promotion of GaOx-based dehydrogenation catalysts appears to be limited, although a patent by Iezzi et al. claims that a catalyst comprising 1.2 wt % Ga2O3, <99 ppm of Pt, and 1.6 wt % of SiO2 on an Al2O3 support represents a highly active formulation in the dehydrogenation reaction. (247) Indeed, when this catalyst is used for PDH, a conversion of 39% and a selectivity of 85% can be obtained after 150 h of time-on-stream at 580 C, with frequent regenerations at 650 C. These values are the highest among those reported for Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts. However, which metal, Pt or Ga, is predominately responsible for the high activity of this catalyst, is not discussed.
In recent work by Sattler et al., a 3 wt % Ga/Al2O3 catalyst was promoted with 1000 ppm of Pt and 0.25 wt % of K to obtain a highly active, selective, and stable PDH catalyst. (248) Evidently, the function of K was to reduce coke formation by poisoning Brnsted acid sites. However, Pt is believed to act as a promoter for the GaOx. Indeed, albeit 1000 ppm Pt/Al2O3 was found to be virtually inactive, 1000 ppm of Pt in combination with 3 wt % Ga afforded conversions close to the equilibrium and an propylene selectivity <95%. In the absence of Pt, propane conversion is more than halved. It was suggested that the role of Pt is to assist hydrogen desorption, which facilitates the regeneration of the gallium hydride hydroxide species. The catalytic data on the Ga-based formulations discussed above are summarized in Table 7.

4.6 Carbon-Based Catalysts
Carbon materials have been tested as the support in catalysts employed for various reactions, mostly because of their high surface area and the fact that these materials are both inexpensive and environmentally friendly. Moreover, discrete functionalities of activated carbon can catalyze an array of reactions, including alkane dehydrogenation. (250) McGregor et al. have reported that a VOx/Al2O3 catalyst completely encapsulated by coke deposits (see Figure 26) is active in butane dehydrogenation. (215) The fact that catalytic activity remained the same despite complete coke encapsulation is remarkable, as this extent of coking usually results in a drastic decrease in activity. The authors hypothesized that the carbon species formed on the catalyst surface were in fact catalyzing the reaction. The highest activity was observed at 700 C, a temperature at which the carbon deposits display a very ordered structure. In view of this, the authors decided to test their hypothesis by using carbon nanofibers (CNFs) as a catalyst under similar conditions. Tellingly, CNFs proved to be catalytically active. It was concluded that radicals formed on the surface of coke facilitate the dehydrogenation reaction, albeit at elevated temperatures the noncatalytic conversion of propane is also relatively high. However, elevated temperatures also lead to a drop in selectivity, as cracking becomes the dominant reaction. Interestingly, the latter was not the case in the work of McGregor et al., who reported a selectivity toward butenes of 80%. Furthermore, hybrid nanocarbon, comprising a diamond core and a graphitic shell, displayed activity for the dehydrogenation of propane, which was attributed to the presence of either ketone groups or structural defects in the graphitic material. (251)
Figure 26
Figure 26. TEM images of VOx/Al2O3 after butane dehydrogenation at 550 C (left) and 700 C (center and right). The high magnification image of the catalyst deactivated at 700 C clearly shows that the catalyst is completely enveloped in a carbon layer a few nanometers thick. Nevertheless, this catalyst still displays a relatively high activity at 700 C. Reprinted from ref 215, copyright 2010, with permission from Elsevier.
In previous work, CNFs had been shown to be active in the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane, although in this case surface oxygen groups were believed to be the active sites. (252) Furthermore, nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) showed some activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, although conversion and selectivity were relatively low. (253)
Liu et al. prepared carbon-based ordered mesoporous systems that showed activity in the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of steam or oxidants. (254) The active sites were proposed to be oxygen-containing groups (CO), which are formed during a pretreatment step involving nitric acid. The catalyst shows remarkable long-term stability, displaying conversion and selectivity values of 45% and 85%, respectively, after 100 h of time on stream at 600 C. Experiments in which carbon nanotubes were tested under similar conditions resulted in low activity.
Neylon et al. studied the activity of supported early transition metal (groups 5 and 6) nitrides and carbides in butane dehydrogenation, (255, 256) as the catalytic properties of these materials are believed to be similar to those of platinum. Interestingly, Mo, V, and W carbides and nitrides showed activity in both dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, displaying specific activities similar to those of a commercial PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. Niobium carbide and nitride did not show any activity. The group 6 compounds tested were found to be more active, albeit they primarily catalyzed hydrogenolysis. In Table 8 are shown the catalytic data of the carbon-based dehydrogenation catalysts as reported by McGregor et al. and Liu et al.
In addition, silica supported metal sulfides, such as ZnS, FeS, CuS, CoS, MnS, NiS, and MoS, were tested for the dehydrogenation of isobutane, and were found to perform significantly better than their respective oxides. The materials show higher initial yields than commercial CrOx and PtSn catalyst, but they deactivate over a few hours due to sulfur leaching. (257)

4.7 Other Formulations
Indium is known to share many of the catalytic properties of gallium, a prominent example being the activity that both metals display in NOx reduction. (258) These similarities are relatively unsurprising, particularly taking into account the adjacency of Ga and In within the same group of the periodic table. Interestingly, Halasz et al. have tested the reactivity of propane on Ga- and In-loaded ZSM-5 and found both catalysts to be active in PDH and display similar activity and selectivity values. (259) However, both Ga/ZSM-5 and In/ZSM-5 did not exclusively yield propylene, but also larger aromatic molecules. Whereas dehydrogenation and aromatization activity were found to be associated with Lewis acidity, cracking and coke formation were related to Brnsted acidity.
Chen et al. mixed In2O3 with other metal oxides in an effort to obtain an active PDH catalyst. (260) A mixed oxide consisting of 20% In2O3 and 80% Al2O3 showed the highest propylene yield, as shown in Figure 27. Small In2O3 clusters on the surface of the catalyst were reduced under reaction conditions to form small metallic In particles. Because no correlation between surface acidity and reactivity was observed, these metallic particles were believed to be the species active in dehydrogenation. The reduction of these particles is a slow process during reaction, and thus a considerable amount of time is required to attain the optimal yields. By prereducing the catalyst with hydrogen, high conversions were immediately obtained. Similar conclusions were reached in a study involving a series of oxide-supported In2O3-based catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. (261) Al2O3 and ZrO2 were more suitable supports than SiO2, as the interaction of the indium oxide was stronger with the former carriers, resulting in a better distribution of small nanoparticles.
CO2 was reported by the same authors to have a beneficial effect, which was ascribed to the occurrence of the reverse watergas shift reaction (RWGS). Furthermore, sufficiently high CO2:hydrocarbon ratios proved capable of retarding catalyst deactivation.

Figure 27. Propane conversion on a series of 20% In80% metal mixed oxides showing InAlOx to be the most active formulation (left). Albeit other In:Al ratios were tested, 20% In80% Al afforded the highest propylene yield. The TPR profiles of different InAl mixed oxides after H2 reduction at 500 C and subsequent treatment with CO2 at 600 C are also shown (right). The peak at around 700 C (labeled β) represents the reduction of In2O3 to In0; the total hydrogen consumption showing the In2O3 is nearly completely reduced to In0. The peak at 300 C (labeled α) corresponds to the reduction of small In2O3 domains in the mixed oxide and suggests the formation of small metallic In particles. The absence of this peak in the top trace suggests that CO2 cannot reoxidize these particles at 600 C. The graph to the left is reprinted from ref 260, copyright 2010, with permission from Elsevier.

Albeit supported iron oxides have been known to be active in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation since 1946, (264) it was not until the 1990s that Geus and co-workers investigated the activity of supported iron oxide in the dehydrogenation of 1-butene to 13 butadiene. (265-268) The authors determined that Fe3+ is the catalytically active species. The catalysts deactivate rapidly due to coke deposition and reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4. However, catalyst stability is significantly enhanced by the addition of potassium. On the one hand, K stabilizes the active phase by forming KFeO2, which donates electrons to the active iron species and prevents their reduction. On the other hand, the acidic groups responsible for coke formation are poisoned by potassium ions. Optimal stability was obtained with a FeOx monolayer, regardless of the type of support employed. An interesting sulfate-promoted FeOx/Al2O3 catalytic system was reported by Sun et al., which showed excellent activity in propane dehydrogenation, accompanied by relatively high stability. (269) The sulfate groups were found to withdraw electrons from Fe, enhancing the acidity of Fe sites and improving activity. Unfortunately, the sulfate groups were not completely stable, and the loss of sulfate groups as SO2 resulted in the irreversible deactivation of the catalyst by carburization and sintering.
In a recent publication by Yun et al., an active propane dehydrogenation catalyst was obtained by incorporating Fe ions in the framework of ZSM-5 zeolites. The catalytic activity was explained by the redox properties of these sites (Fe2+ and Fe3+ redox cycle) that resulted in the formation of radical intermediates. (270) Shimada et al. investigated the use of activated carbon, promoted by Fe, as a catalyst for the dehydrogenation of isobutane. (250) In the absence of iron, activated carbon was only able to afford an isobutene yield of 10%, albeit this value increased to 40% upon the addition of 3.5 wt % Fe3O4 in the presence of CO2. In addition to dehydrogenation, the iron oxide also catalyzes the RWGS reaction. Indeed, XRD results show that the iron oxide is reduced by the hydrocarbon feed, and subsequently reoxidized by the CO2 in the feed.
The conversion of light alkanes to aromatics on Zn supported on H-ZSM-5 zeolites has received considerable attention. (100, 271-275) Isolated Zn2+ species with a tetrahedral orientation were deemed to be the active sites, with a reaction mechanism similar to that reported on GaOx-based dehydrogenation catalysts. (276-280) These species resided in the cation exchange sites of the zeolite, effectively providing the counter-charge for two Al species. The proximity of Al species was found to be important, as calculations show basic Al-bound oxygen is required to perform the CH cleavage and form an AlOH group. This is important, as, similar to Ga, ZnH and ZnOH groups are difficult to regenerate. Furthermore, these species were found to be highly stable, which is important as volatile Zn species may be formed at dehydrogenation reaction conditions.
The activity of zinc titanate in the dehydrogenation of light olefins has also been studied, the catalysts being prepared either as hydrogels or as mixed oxides. Chen et al. investigated mixed oxides with different zinc to titanium ratios and found that a Zn:Ti ratio of 2 resulted in the most active catalyst. Cubic Zn2TiO3 was deemed to be the active species in dehydrogenation, although the overall activity of these catalysts was found to be limited. (281-283) More recently, isolated Zn2+ species deposited on a silica support were found to be active in propane dehydrogenation. (284) The active sites were determined to be coordinatively unsaturated Zn2+ Lewis acids sites located on a tri-membered siloxane ring on the silica support. During the catalytic reaction, the Zn is transformed to tricoordinated species due to the temperature increase. DFT calculations suggested a reaction mechanism akin to that observed over CrOx and GaOx catalysts.
In Table 9 are shown the catalytic activity data of the indium- and iron-based dehydrogenation catalysts discussed.

5 Comparing Different Catalysts

5.1 In Terms of Reaction Mechanism and Deactivation Pathway
Even though the dehydrogenation reaction has been studied for almost a century, the exact mechanism is still a topic under debate, particularly because this reaction is catalyzed by a vast array of materials as different as noble metals and transition metal oxides. The so-called HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, which was proposed in 1934, is most commonly used to describe catalytic dehydrogenation reactions. (285) This mechanism follows LangmuirHinshelwood kinetics, where all of the surface sites of the catalyst are considered to be identical. The HoriutiPolanyi mechanism consists of four main steps: dissociative adsorption of the paraffin, CH cleavage of a second hydrogen atom, formation of a hydrogen molecule, and subsequent desorption of both the hydrogen and the olefin, as is shown in Scheme 2ag. (286) Notably, both CH cleavage steps (229, 263, 287-289) and the dissociative adsorption of the paraffin have been suggested as the rate-limiting step of the dehydrogenation reaction. (96, 98, 144, 290)
Several studies have been performed on Pt and PtSn catalysts to gain a detailed understanding of the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction. First, isotopic labeling experiments have been used to identify the reaction intermediates. For example, cofeeding D2 during ethane dehydrogenation resulted in a single deuterium being attached to the ethane molecules, suggesting an ethyl reaction intermediate. (291) However, because the dehydrogenation reaction is an equilibrium-controlled reaction, compounds can react back and forth leading to isotopic scrambling, which complicates the interpretation of experimental results.
Scheme 2
Scheme 2. Dehydrogenation Mechanism As Proposed by Horiuti and Polanyi on a Pt Surfacea
Scheme aThe intermediates depicted have been observed by IR spectroscopy during the hydrogenation reaction at low temperatures and are supported by theoretical calculations. The dissociative adsorption of propane may also take place by the abstraction of the β-hydrogen, forming a 2-propyl intermediate, but for brevity this pathway is not shown. High paraffin pressures favor the formation of propylidyne species (step h-j), which are coke precursors. These species are relatively stable and can only be hydrogenated when high concentrations of hydrogen are present on the Pt surface. (292-297)
Infrared spectroscopy is another valuable tool to detect intermediates formed during dehydrogenation reactions on Pt-based catalysts. Because of experimental limitations, this is done through the study of the reverse hydrogenation reaction, which takes places at considerably lower temperatures. This approach assumes that the same reaction intermediates are encountered, which needs to be verified due to the significantly different reaction conditions. During the adsorption of ethylene on both Pt and PtSn surfaces at temperatures ranging from 100 to 27 C, several species are detected, including ethylidyne as well as π-bonded and di-σ-bonded ethylene (the propylene analogues of which are shown in Scheme 2). (116, 117, 298-300) Cremer et al. used sum frequency generation IR to elucidate the role of these ethylene adspecies on a Pt (111) surface. (301, 302) During ethylene hydrogenation, ethylidyne was found to be a spectator species, although one competing for active sites on the catalyst surface. On the other hand, π-bonded ethylene was determined to be the main intermediate of ethylene hydrogenation, although di-σ-bonded ethylene was also converted at a lower rate. Ethyl groups are only detected at very high hydrogen pressures, as these species readily convert to di-σ-ethylene otherwise. Nevertheless, Zaera et al. have reported that the reaction mechanism of ethylene hydrogenation involves a π-bonded ethylene and an ethyl intermediate. (303) Furthermore, when propylene adsorption on Pt (111) was studied by reflectionabsorption IR spectroscopy, most of the propylene was found to be coordinated as di-σ-bonded, albeit π-bonded propylene was found to predominate at high surface coverages. (292) On the contrary, DFT calculations showed that propylene is preferentially adsorbed in the disigma mode. (75, 114) DFT calculations performed on Pt, Pt3Sn, and Pt2Sn (111) surfaces during the PDH reaction have revealed that the dissociative adsorption of the alkane is the rate-limiting step. In the presence of Sn, this energy barrier is increased, as is shown in Figure 28, therefore decreasing the activity of the catalyst. (114, 118) On Pt (111) the dehydrogenation may proceed by a 1- or a 2-propyl intermediate, while on the PtSn alloys the 1-propyl intermediate is favored. The positive effect of Sn on catalytic activity is explained by the facile desorption of propylene, which hinders further dehydrogenation of the adsorbed propylene.
Figure 28
Figure 28. Energy profiles for propane dehydrogenation to propylene on Pt (111) (black), Pt3Sn (111) (blue), and Pt2Sn (111) (red) surfaces, as obtained by DFT calculations. The intermediates are shown along with their corresponding energies. The recombination of the hydrogen adatoms is not considered. (114) The values of potential energy for all intermediates are given relative to the potential energy of a propane molecule in the gas phase and a clean catalyst surface.
Microcalorimetry has afforded complementary information on the dehydrogenation mechanism over Pt-based catalysts, a lower heat of adsorption of ethylene being detected on the PtSn relative to the Pt surface (94135 and 157 kJ mol1, respectively). (117, 296) These relatively high heat of adsorption values are generally indicative of the dissociative adsorption of a hydrocarbon. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the adsorption of ethane on different Pt and PtSn alloy surfaces, (111) and (211), have revealed that electron transfer takes place from Sn to Pt. Keeping in mind the fact that Sn addition reduces the heat of adsorption, the formation of ethylidyne becomes energetically less favorable because of this electron transfer. (117, 118, 289, 304) In addition, by studying these different PtSn alloys, it was shown that the presence of Sn reduces the amount of highly active Pt step sites, on which reaction intermediates adsorb strongly. (304) The latter observation is rendered particularly noteworthy by the fact that isotopic labeling experiments, performed by Galvita et al. during ethane dehydrogenation, have revealed that ethylene can form methane and coke through cracking, the conversion proceeding via an ethylidyne intermediate. (132, 290)
The dehydrogenation mechanism on chromia-based catalysts is somewhat different, as both the chromium and the oxygen atoms of the oxide are believed to participate in the reaction. (305) Quantum chemical methods (DFT) have been used by Lillehaug et al. to study the mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation on a series of clusters containing a single Cr3+ ion bonded to OH or OSi groups species, which served as a model for the different active sites suggested in literature. (306, 307) The first step they proposed is CH activation via σ-bond metathesis resulting in the formation of CrC and OH bonds, followed by a β-H transfer to a Cr site. (306, 308) The final step proposed is the formation of hydrogen and the desorption of the latter and ethylene. An alternative mechanism, in which a CrH species activates ethane by forming molecular hydrogen and an adsorbed ethyl species, has been proposed on the basis of the results of isotopic labeling experiments performed during ethane dehydrogenation on a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. (144) The two main mechanisms proposed for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes on chromia/alumina catalysts are shown in Scheme 3. In these mechanisms, either the dissociative adsorption (144, 305) or β-H elimination is believed to be the rate-limiting step. (306, 309, 310) Figure 29 shows two reaction cycles in an energy diagram, as calculated by Lillehaug et al. Indeed, the energy barrier is the highest for the initial CH activation, although this energy is significantly lower when the bond is activated by the CrH intermediate (i.e., the right part of Scheme 3). Nevertheless, hydrogen desorption is preferred, as the energy barrier is lower.
In situ FTIR spectroscopy has provided evidence of the formation of acetaldehyde and acetone intermediates as ethane and propane are adsorbed on a mesoporous chromiaalumina catalyst. (197) Furthermore, during the dehydrogenation of propane on a CrOx catalyst, surface species including aliphatic, unsaturated, and aromatic carbon species, along with acetates and carboxylates, have been detected by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). (192, 197, 311) This is consistent with a model in which the first step of the reaction is the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkane to form an alkoxide species (ethoxide and isopropoxide being formed from ethane and propane, respectively). However, the reduction of the catalyst prior to the dehydrogenation reaction led to a dramatic decrease in the amounts of acetates and carboxylates detected, albeit the reaction rate remained unaffected. Evidently, the latter throws into question the role of acetic and carboxylic species as reaction intermediates. An alternative interpretation is that these species are formed during the reduction of the Cr6+ species by hydrocarbons present in the feed. Parenthetically, the involvement of hydrocarbons in the formation of reduced active chromium sites, the participation of both chromium and oxygen atoms in the reaction, and the proposition that CH activation represents the first reaction step are somewhat reminiscent of the Phillips catalyst and of the mechanism of ethylene polymerization recently proposed by Copret and co-workers over this formulation. (312, 313) However, additional work will be necessary to investigate the relationship between the mechanisms of ethylene polymerization and ethane dehydrogenation, particularly in view of the different nature of the reactions and the reaction conditions.

Note that for the second section of the scheme, a second propane molecule is dehydrogenated. (314, 315) The values of potential energy for all intermediates are given relative to the potential energy of a propane molecule in the gas phase and a clean catalyst surface.
The reaction mechanism on GaOx has been studied by Liu et al. by DFT calculations on a Ga (100) surface (Figure 30). (231) A mechanism similar to that shown in Scheme 3 was proposed, except for the fact that the initial CH activation takes place involving a radical, which can adsorb on the Ga site as an ethyl species, or directly undergo the second CH cleavage step. The desorption of both hydrogen and propylene was found to be energetically unfavorable, which was used to explain the rapid coking and the relative low activity of GaOx-based dehydrogenation catalysts. Indeed, while heating Ga2O3 in an ethane atmosphere, the evolution of Ga-ethyl and hydroxyl surface species was observed by DRIFTS at 150 C. (316)

Intermediates analogous to those displayed in Scheme 3 are shown along with their relative energies. Note that two pathways for the dehydrogenation of propane are considered, one involving a radical intermediate and another an ethyl intermediate, the former having a lower energy barrier. (314, 315) The values of potential energy for all intermediates are given relative to the potential energy of a propane molecule in the gas phase and a clean catalyst surface.
To summarize, most of the experimental results suggest that the dehydrogenation of light alkanes proceeds via the HoriutiPolanyi mechanism, where either the dissociative adsorption of the alkane or the second CH bond cleavage is the rate-determining step. Evidence of fundamental differences in the reaction mechanism on metal oxide and noble metal catalysts is lacking, although reports of mechanistic studies involving metal oxide catalysts are admittedly scant.
All dehydrogenation catalysts deactivate with time-on-stream, several processes being responsible for the deactivation of the different types of catalysts discussed in this Review. However, there has been a clear consensus in the literature since the mid-1970s identifying coke deposition as the main cause of deactivation. (77, 317-319) Coke is a collective name given to a large family of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reaction. Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity. Therefore, the detrimental effect of coke is largely dependent on catalyst design and the location of the coke deposits. (320)
The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood. Brnsted acid and others active sites of the catalysts serve as seeding points to which olefins and paraffins are added until large graphitic structures are formed. Indeed, olefins in the stream can easily react with the carbocation intermediates formed on these acid sites. Additionally, strong adsorption of reaction intermediates, such as the ethylidyne or ethyne species discussed above, (75, 132, 290) and/or products on active sites can also induce polymerization and lead to the formation of graphitic sheets. In Scheme 4, several pathways for the formation of the first aromatic ring structures from propylidyne and similar molecules are proposed, which include cracking, deep dehydrogenation, and polymerization reactions.

Scheme aNote that the adsorbed hydrocarbons shown in the scheme are examples of species formed on the Pt surface, and that they actually represent a family of similar species.
Scheme 5
Scheme 5. Proposed Mechanisms for the Growth of Polyaromatic Species by Either DielsAlder-type Addition, Propylene Addition via Radical Chemistry, or Fusion of Small Domains into Larger Ones (322, 323)a
Scheme aThe species will continue to grow in a similar fashion, and at a certain point are considered to be graphene-like sheets. The molecules in the scheme are only simplified hydrogen-deficient coke precursors that may be present on the surface of the catalyst. Such species are directly bonded to the Pt surface and in reality will contain significant amounts of hydrogen, either in hydrogen-terminated aromatic rings or in aliphatic side chains.
Coke species may grow from the resulting aromatic rings by either DielsAlder-type addition, propylene addition to a radical, or fusion of smaller domains, as shown in Scheme 5. When these polyaromatic species are still relatively small, they can also migrate from the metal to the support (where they can undergo further oligomerization and condensation). In fact, the addition of Sn to the Pt-based catalyst facilitates this migration by weakening the binding of the hydrocarbon to the metal. (304, 324, 325) In addition, acid sites present on the support may protonate these small polyaromatics, making them more reactive toward gas-phase olefins. (322, 326) Nevertheless, studies on these processes are scant, which is why the mechanism explaining the progression from adsorbed atomic carbon to aromatic rings is still largely unknown. Therefore, more detailed studies are needed to better understand this process. For example, it would be beneficial to gain a fundamental understanding on the steps proposed in Schemes 4 and 5 to develop strategies to prevent coke formation through these routes.
The location of coke is very important, as coke on the support has a milder negative effect on catalyst activity. (320, 324) However, it is important to note that the presence of carbon deposits on the surface does not always negatively influence catalyst performance. Indeed, a low amount of coke deposition has been observed to increase the catalytic activity by facilitating the adsorption of the alkane near the active dehydrogenation site. (320) Furthermore, highly active sites responsible for side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, are the first to be poisoned by coke, resulting in higher selectivity to the olefin product. Coke becomes detrimental when large graphitic sheets are formed that cover the catalytically active sites. (173, 180) To address this coke-induced deactivation, a regeneration step under an oxidative atmosphere has been incorporated to industrial dehydrogenation processes. This process is relatively straightforward, as coke is easily combusted in air at dehydrogenation reaction temperatures. The ambivalent nature of coke deposits is further highlighted by the fact that their presence on deactivated catalysts is essential in the industrial processes that use coke combustion as the main source of the heat required to run the dehydrogenation reaction.
Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites. Changes in the reaction conditions, such as cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2, can reduce coke formation, (324, 327, 328) whereas high partial pressures of olefins and paraffins exacerbate coke deposition. Even the nature of the alkane reactant has an effect, as coke formed during propane dehydrogenation on a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst is reported to be more detrimental than coke formed during ethane dehydrogenation (although such a comparison is difficult because these reactions run at different temperatures). (132) Alternatively, coke deposition can be reduced by adding a promoter element, the addition of Sn to Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts being the best-known example.
5.2 In Terms of Propane and Isobutane Dehydrogenation Performance
Given that a large variety of catalysts are active in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of C2C4 paraffins, as documented in Tables 39, a comprehensive comparison of the activity and stability of these catalysts is desirable, particularly because said comparison stands to reveal qualitative differences between various formulations. We have attempted this comparison focusing on three performance criteria, olefin yield (obtained at the start of the experiment), stability (expressed as the deactivation rate), and the space velocity at which the first two criteria were measured (expressed as WHSV). In this approach, the effects of various factors, such as pressure, temperature, preparation method, promoter, and catalyst support, are not considered. The reasons to ignore these effects include the fact that this information is missing in many articles (pressure being a notable example), the absence of a clear trend (as tends to be the case with temperature), and an excessively large variance within a single variable to allow a meaningful comparison (catalyst preparation being an instance of such a variable). It is important to note that catalysts were only included in this comparison if the space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield could be determined from the information provided in the original source. Also of note is the fact that the performance criteria compared were measured during propane or isobutane dehydrogenation, which are the reactions that have been researched most intensively.
Figure 31
Figure 31. Propylene yield during propane dehydrogenation (left) and isobutene yield during isobutane dehydrogenation (right) versus the deactivation rate of catalysts included in Tables 39. Each data point is labeled with the number included in the first column of the relevant table, to distinguish between different catalysts. Catalyst systems displaying high yields combined with low deactivation rates are preferred.
In Figure 31, the yields of propylene and isobutene are plotted versus the deactivation rate of Pt-, CrOx-, GaOx-, and In2O3-based catalysts. Moreover, in the plot showing PDH results, the data points representing the catalytic performance of different catalyst types are grouped around similar values, the best initial yields being similar for Pt and CrOx and slightly higher for GaOx. Additionally, PDH results show that the different catalyst types deactivate at different speeds, with Pt being particularly stable, CrOx deactivating rapidly, and other systems deactivating even faster. Another interesting observation stemming from the PDH data is that within each type of catalyst high yields often coincide with relatively low deactivation rates, which is counterintuitive. Although considerably fewer data points are available for the isobutane dehydrogenation, the Pt-based catalysts also display a superior stability as compared to the metal oxides at similar yields. Notably, the VOx-based catalysts show excellent yields (40%), albeit they deactivate very fast.
Space velocity is another important factor that has been considered to compare the performance of different dehydrogenation catalysts. In Figure 32 are plotted propylene and isobutene yield aagainst the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV).
Figure 32
Figure 32. Yield of propylene and isobutene versus WHSV (left and right, respectively) of the catalysts included in Tables 39. High yields obtained at high space velocities are preferred. Therefore, because Pt-based catalysts can afford comparable yields to catalysts based on metal oxides while operating at higher space velocities, they are deemed superior in this respect.
To be commercially attractive, dehydrogenation catalysts must provide high olefin yields at high space velocities. In other words, catalysts should display high specific activity, which is to say good conversion at short contact times. Figure 32 illustrates that while the yields obtained over GaOx-, CrOx-, and Pt-based propane dehydrogenation catalysts are comparable, GaOx-, CrOx-, and Pt-based catalysts operate at relatively low, intermediate, and high space velocities, respectively.
Taking into account that Pt-based catalysts typically have low loadings (<1 wt %), whereas GaOx- and CrOx-based catalysts generally have loadings between 5 and 20 wt %, it is clear that on a weight basis Pt represents the most active formulation in PDH. This is confirmed when the average specific activities from Tables 39 are compared to one another. Indeed, for the dehydrogenation of propane on Pt-based catalysts, the average specific activity is 2.86 × 101 s1, which is considerably higher than the average specific activities over CrOx and GaOx, which are 7.49 × 105 and 8.17 × 105, respectively. In Scheme 6, the proposed active sites for propane dehydrogenation of these three catalysts are shown. In the case of platinum-based catalysts, any Pt0 atom located at the surface is believed to catalyze the reaction, while in CrOx- and GaOx-based catalysts Cr3+ and Ga3+ must be coordinatively unsaturated to display catalytic activity. This similarity between the active sites of Ga- and Cr-containing catalyst, and their difference to Pt, may therefore explain the relative specific activity values of these formulations.
However, it should be noted that specific activity values are a very rough approximation of the real TOF of these catalysts. In case of Pt catalysts, all Pt (not only the surface Pt) is taken into account in our specific activity calculation, and additional errors are introduced for the metal oxides. In the case of CrOx catalysts, only coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species are active in the dehydrogenation reaction, yet our specific activity calculations take into account a considerable amount of species that are either coordinatively saturated or in a different oxidation state. Although Ga3+ is likely the only stable species during the dehydrogenation reaction, our specific activity calculation involving GaOx catalysts considers a significant amount of the Ga that is either present in the framework of the support or incorporated in larger Ga2O3 crystallites. Nevertheless, the difference between the specific activity calculated for Pt and the metal oxides is in the range of 4 orders of magnitude, which cannot be explained solely by the errors introduced in our calculations. For the dehydrogenation of isobutane, the same differences of specific activities between the Pt and metal oxide catalysts are observed.
It is important to mention that catalysts tend to deactivate faster when higher space velocities are used. Notably, metal oxide-based catalysts deactivate faster than the Pt-based formulations, despite the fact that the latter are commonly used at higher space velocities, which highlights the remarkable stability of Pt catalysts.
The differences in the specific activity values described previously could be explained by comparing the activation energies calculated by DFT methods previously discussed in section 4. In these calculations, the energy barrier for the rate limiting step on PtSn system is lower (109 kJ mol1) than in the CrOx and GaOx catalysts (161 and 163 kJ mol1, respectively). Ea affects the reaction rate, as described by the Arrhenius equation:
where k is the reaction rate constant, A is the pre-exponential factor, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature. By calculating k/A at a temperature of 600 C and assuming A is comparable for the three systems considered, the rate constant is 103 times higher for the PtSn catalysts as compared to the metal oxide catalysts. The difference in the calculated specific activity values for propane dehydrogenation on the Pt and metal oxide catalysts (Tables 3, 4, and 7) is approximately 104, as is shown in Scheme 6. The higher activity observed for the Pt-based catalysts may therefore be explained by the significantly lower energy barrier of the rate-limiting step. However, care must be taken when comparing these Ea values, as the methods used for obtaining these are not identical. Furthermore, these simulations assume model surfaces that do not resemble real catalyst systems, and therefore the results are not necessarily representative of the experimentally observed reaction rates. Nevertheless, these combined theoretical and experimental data are very encouraging and highlight the need for more extensive studies on the reaction rate on Pt- and metal oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts.
To summarize, although metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, the latter can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates than metal oxide catalysts.

6 Conclusions and Emerging Areas of Research
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Because of their widespread use as feedstock in the chemical industry, the demand for olefins is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future. Additionally, the recent surge in shale gas production has rendered the cost of natural gas very economical as compared to that of crude oil. Therefore, alternative methods for obtaining olefins, dehydrogenation and MTO, have become very competitive relative to more traditional methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking. Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years. The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts. These catalysts and technologies have been advanced to a point where the reaction can be run continuously for several years. Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Moreover, steps will need to be taken to overcome the reactions biggest drawbacks, that is, the limited equilibrium conversion and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures.
Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed. Indeed, these alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step. Thus, further research will also be necessary to address these issues.
Nevertheless, advancements can also be expected in other areas. Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation. Because an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, full conversion of the paraffin can be achieved. O2 and CO2 have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each having distinct advantages and disadvantages. In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1)). Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity. (252, 329, 330) CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture. However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction. The cofeeding of CO2 may result in additional coke deposition, due to the increased CO and decreased H2 partial pressures brought about by the reverse watergas shift reaction. On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2. Finally, CO2 competitively adsorbs on the surface, specifically on the basic sites of the catalyst materials, which can negatively affect their performance. (162, 175, 331) In short, finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins.
An alternative solution lies in the use of solid oxygen carriers, such as CeO2, SbO4, In2O3, WO3, PbOx, Tl2O3, and BiO3, capable of selectively oxidizing the hydrogen evolved by the SHC reaction. (332-334) Noble metals, such as Pt and Au, can also catalyze the SHC process, but in this case oxygen is cofed to facilitate the hydrogen combustion. (335, 336) Because the SHC reaction consumes the lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts, the latter require frequent regeneration with oxygen. Moreover, the reaction rate is relatively low and some of these metal oxides are highly toxic. These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application.
Another method of removing the hydrogen from the reaction mixture is the introduction of membranes to the reactor system. This approach allows hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor, shifting the equilibrium toward the desired olefin product. (337-344) A large variety of membranes have been investigated, such as Pd-coated mesoporous alumina, PtAg composites, and membranes involving either molybdenum- or carbon-based molecular sieves. The inverse relationship between permeability and selectivity of the membranes is a serious problem, as both qualities are desired. Catalyst deactivation represents an additional challenge, as coke deposition increases when the hydrogen partial pressure drops. Nevertheless, nearly all studies report increased olefin yields when a membrane system is used.
It is very important to heed the interplay between catalyst deactivation and regeneration in industrial settings. Indeed, for both the Pt and the CrOx formulations used industrially, the elimination of coke from the surface of the spent catalysts may result in irreversible catalyst deactivation if the regeneration conditions are not carefully controlled. Currently, this is done in a very crude manner, by monitoring the gas composition at the reactor outlet. However, recent reports suggest that in the near future, operando spectroscopy will provide the means for more sophisticated process control. (198) Indeed, Raman/UVvis spectroscopy can be used to monitor noninvasively the amount and type of coke as the latter forms and accumulates on the catalyst surface. (173, 180, 345, 346) As is shown in Figure 33, spatiotemporal differences in the coke deposition on a catalyst bed consisting of CrOx/Al2O3 extrudates were visualized in a pilot scale reactor using two UVvis probes, which collected spectra in a continuous fashion during propane dehydrogenation. (198) Coke deposition was observed to occur faster at the top of the catalyst bed, which was attributed to the temperature gradient measured in the reactor. Furthermore, coke combustion proceeded in an inhomogeneous fashion, coke at the top of the catalyst bed being combusted first.
Figure 33
Figure 33. To the left, a schematic representation of the pilot-scale reactor used for propane dehydrogenation is shown. Two UVvis probes are inserted in the reactor to visualize the deactivation of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst as a function of time and catalyst bed height (the spectra acquired are shown in the center of the figure). This technique is excellent to visualize the coke-induced darkening of the catalyst extrudates from green to black, as is shown in the photographs to the right. Reproduced from ref 198, copyright 2013, by permission of The Royal Society of Chemistry.
These measurements show that the duration of the dehydrogenation and regeneration phases could be dynamically adjusted to keep the catalyst in its most active state, as moderate amounts of coke are believed to assist the dehydrogenation reaction while excessive amounts lead to catalyst deactivation (vide supra). The latter would undoubtedly represent an improvement to the way in which reversible deactivation is currently addressed. As an additional advantage, UVvis spectroscopy can be used to monitor the long-term irreversible deactivation of the catalyst. Indeed, because the relative amounts of active chromia and of chromium that has become irreversibly deactivated due to its migration into the support can be measured by UVvis spectroscopy, this technique provides a means to determine when the catalyst needs replacing.
This analysis has been taken a step further by designing, constructing, and testing probes for operando Raman spectroscopy, which were used to obtain information on the chemical nature of the coke deposits formed during reaction. Furthermore, by using the operando UVvis spectra as a measure for catalyst darkening, a quantitative analysis of the coke deposits could be performed during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction by operando Raman spectroscopy. (49, 180, 346)
Therefore, the monitoring of industrial chromiaalumina catalysts by combined time-resolved UVvis and Raman spectroscopies can be employed to improve the overall efficiency of future alkane dehydrogenation processes.
