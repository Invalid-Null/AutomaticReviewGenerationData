<quotes>
[1] "Furthermore, in situ spectroscopic techniques made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. As is shown in Figure 14 with XANES and in Figure 15 with UV-vis spectroscopy, it was observed that surface Cr3+ species are produced at the expense of Cr6+ species during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction and that polychromate is more easily reduced than monochromate."

[2] "Parenthetically, the involvement of hydrocarbons in the formation of reduced active chromium sites, the participation of both chromium and oxygen atoms in the reaction, and the proposition that CH activation represents the first reaction step are somewhat reminiscent of the Phillips catalyst and of the mechanism of ethylene polymerization recently proposed by Copret and co-workers over this formulation."

[3] "Therefore, the monitoring of industrial chromia-alumina catalysts by combined time-resolved UV-vis and Raman spectroscopies can be employed to improve the overall efficiency of future alkane dehydrogenation processes."

Answer: The article utilizes in situ XANES and UV-vis spectroscopy to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts based on CrOx/Al2O3. These techniques reveal that Cr6+ species are reduced to Cr3+ during the initial stages of the reaction, with polychromate reducing more readily than monochromate. The article also suggests using combined operando UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy to monitor industrial CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts and optimize the dehydrogenation process.

Answer: 该文献采用原位XANES和紫外-可见光谱技术来研究工作中的丙烷脱氢CrOx/Al2O3催化剂。这些技术揭示了Cr6+物种在反应初期被还原成Cr3+,其中聚铬酸盐比一元铬酸盐更容易被还原。该文献还建议联合使用原位紫外-可见光谱和拉曼光谱来监测工业CrOx/Al2O3催化剂,以优化脱氢过程。
