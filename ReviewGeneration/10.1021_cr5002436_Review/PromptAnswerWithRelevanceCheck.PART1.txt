1. The article evaluates CrOx, Pt-Sn, and GaOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on conversion, selectivity, specific activity, and stability for various catalyst formulations (Tables 3-7). The CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst shows moderate activity but deactivates rapidly. Pt-Sn/Al2O3 is very active and stable but expensive. Promising results are reported for GaOx, with high initial activity similar to Pt-Sn, but faster deactivation. 
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
1. 该文章评估了CrOx、Pt-Sn和GaOx催化剂用于丙烷脱氢反应。它提供了各种催化剂配方的转化率、选择性、特定活性和稳定性的数据(表3-7)。CrOx/Al2O3催化剂显示适度的活性,但快速脱活。Pt-Sn/Al2O3活性非常高,稳定性好,但昂贵。研究报告GaOx具有很有前景,其最初的活性与Pt-Sn相当,但脱活更快。
</Chinese version answer>

<English version answer>
2. The article investigates how oxidation state affects propane dehydrogenation performance over CrOx catalysts. It states that Cr3+ species are the most active, while Cr6+ and Cr5+ need to be reduced to Cr3+ under reaction conditions to show activity. Insights into the effects of acid-base properties are also provided. Basic promoters like alkali metals can enhance CrOx catalysts by stabilizing the alumina support and reducing surface acidity.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
2. 该文章研究了氧化态如何影响CrOx催化剂上的丙烷脱氢性能。它指出,Cr3+物种是最活跃的,而Cr6+和Cr5+需要在反应条件下还原为Cr3+才能显示活性。该文章还提供了关于酸碱性质影响的见解。碱性促进剂(如碱金属)可以通过稳定氧化铝载体和减少表面酸度来增强CrOx催化剂。
</Chinese version answer>

<English version answer>
3. The article proposes a mechanistic scenario for propane dehydrogenation over CrOx catalysts involving CH activation to form a chromium-alkyl intermediate, followed by β-H elimination to yield propylene. DFT calculations suggest the initial CH activation is the rate-limiting step. Reaction intermediates like ethoxide and acetates are detected on the catalyst surface.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
3. 该文章提出了CrOx催化剂上丙烷脱氢的机理方案,先通过CH活化生成铬-烷基中间体,然后通过β-H消除产生丙烯。 DFT计算表明,初始CH活化是速率控制步骤。乙氧基和乙酸酯等反应中间体被检测到存在于催化剂表面。

1. The article does not evaluate any specific metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It focuses more on Pt-based and CrOx-based catalysts.

2. The article does not investigate tuning metal oxide properties for propane dehydrogenation.

3. The article does not propose mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts.

4. The article does not explore metal-support effects for metal oxide catalysts in propane dehydrogenation.

 Unfortunately the literature provided does not contain relevant quotes or information to directly answer the specific questions asked. The review article focuses on evaluating different metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, VOx, MoOx, GaOx and InOx for propane dehydrogenation, and provides some insights into how properties like oxidation state, acidity, metal-support interactions etc. affect the catalytic performance. However, it does not investigate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir. The article also does not propose detailed mechanistic pathways or reaction intermediates for propane dehydrogenation over the catalysts studied. Since the questions ask for specific examples, data and insights not covered in the given literature, I cannot provide direct relevant quotes or answers. I apologize that the literature is inadequate for answering the specific questions posed. Please let me know if you would like me to attempt to summarize or draw inferences from the provided text to best address the questions.

1. The article evaluates CrOx, Pt-Sn, and GaOx catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data on propane conversion, olefin selectivity, and stability over these catalysts. For example, a 5 wt% CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst showed 37-26% propane conversion with 85-92% propylene selectivity at 550°C and 1.2 WHSV (Table 4, entry 6). The article also discusses how properties like oxidation state, coordination, and dispersion of active sites like Cr3+, Pt, and Ga3+ influence activity and selectivity.
