 Unfortunately the literature provided does not contain relevant quotes or information to directly answer the specific questions asked. The review article focuses on evaluating different metal oxide catalysts like CrOx, VOx, MoOx, GaOx and InOx for propane dehydrogenation, and provides some insights into how properties like oxidation state, acidity, metal-support interactions etc. affect the catalytic performance. However, it does not investigate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir. The article also does not propose detailed mechanistic pathways or reaction intermediates for propane dehydrogenation over the catalysts studied. Since the questions ask for specific examples, data and insights not covered in the given literature, I cannot provide direct relevant quotes or answers. I apologize that the literature is inadequate for answering the specific questions posed. Please let me know if you would like me to attempt to summarize or draw inferences from the provided text to best address the questions.
