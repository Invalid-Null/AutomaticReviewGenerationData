 Unfortunately, the given literature does not provide any relevant information to answer the questions asked. The article is a review focused on propane and light alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, their preparation, characterization, and performance evaluation. It does not discuss specific techniques for preparing single atom sites in zeolites, metal encapsulation in zeolites, advanced microscopy characterization, membrane reactors, or provide any relevant data on optimizing dispersion or probing oxidation state changes during catalysis. The article only briefly mentions the use of some in situ techniques like DRIFTS and Raman spectroscopy to study working catalysts.

Since there are no relevant quotes from the literature, I will answer each question directly:
