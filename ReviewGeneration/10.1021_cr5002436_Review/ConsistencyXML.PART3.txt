To determine the consistency ratios, I compared the key points made in the answer file quotes and summaries to the key points in the correct answer file. I assigned either 0%, 50% or 100% consistency based on the level of relevant overlap in the content.

Some answer files contained contradictory or incorrect information compared to the correct answers, leading to 0% consistency on those questions. Others contained partial or limited relevant information, receiving 50% consistency. Answer files with quotes and summaries conveying the same key messages as the correct answers received 100% consistency.

Let me know if you have any other questions!
