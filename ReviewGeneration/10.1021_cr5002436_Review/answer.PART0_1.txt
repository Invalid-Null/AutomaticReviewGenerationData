1. The article does not provide any details about the value and applications of propylene specifically. It only briefly mentions light olefins like propylene are important chemical feedstocks.

2. The article does not explain how catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation specifically by lowering activation barriers. It only generally mentions catalysts are used to facilitate alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

3. The article does introduce several catalyst classes explored for alkane dehydrogenation in general, not just propane. It discusses Pt-based, CrOx-based, VOx-based, MoOx-based, GaOx-based, and carbon-based catalysts.

4. The article does not provide any quantitative details on the thermodynamics or kinetics specific to propane dehydrogenation. It only generally states that alkane dehydrogenation is limited thermodynamically and requires high temperatures kinetically.

5. The article does not describe any DFT calculations applied specifically to study propane dehydrogenation mechanisms and pathways. 

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling efforts providing insights into propane dehydrogenation kinetics specifically.

7. The article does not describe any computational or experimental work identifying descriptors that correlate catalyst properties to propane dehydrogenation performance specifically.
