[1] "Furthermore, in situ spectroscopic techniques made it possible to probe these catalysts under reaction conditions. As is shown in Figure 14 with XANES and in Figure 15 with UV-vis spectroscopy, it was observed that surface Cr3+ species are produced at the expense of Cr6+ species during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction and that polychromate is more easily reduced than monochromate."

[2] "Parenthetically, the involvement of hydrocarbons in the formation of reduced active chromium sites, the participation of both chromium and oxygen atoms in the reaction, and the proposition that CH activation represents the first reaction step are somewhat reminiscent of the Phillips catalyst and of the mechanism of ethylene polymerization recently proposed by Copret and co-workers over this formulation."

[3] "Therefore, the monitoring of industrial chromia-alumina catalysts by combined time-resolved UV-vis and Raman spectroscopies can be employed to improve the overall efficiency of future alkane dehydrogenation processes."

<English version answer>
Answer: The article utilizes in situ XANES and UV-vis spectroscopy to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts based on CrOx/Al2O3. These techniques reveal that Cr6+ species are reduced to Cr3+ during the initial stages of the reaction, with polychromate reducing more readily than monochromate. The article also suggests using combined operando UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy to monitor industrial CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts and optimize the dehydrogenation process.

 Unfortunately, the given literature does not provide any relevant information to answer the questions asked. The article is a review focused on propane and light alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, their preparation, characterization, and performance evaluation. It does not discuss specific techniques for preparing single atom sites in zeolites, metal encapsulation in zeolites, advanced microscopy characterization, membrane reactors, or provide any relevant data on optimizing dispersion or probing oxidation state changes during catalysis. The article only briefly mentions the use of some in situ techniques like DRIFTS and Raman spectroscopy to study working catalysts.

Since there are no relevant quotes from the literature, I will answer each question directly:
