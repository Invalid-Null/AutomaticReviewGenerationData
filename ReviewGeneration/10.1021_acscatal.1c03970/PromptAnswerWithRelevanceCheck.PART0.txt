<Answer>

 Unfortunately the given literature does not provide any relevant information to answer the specific questions asked. The literature focuses on the synthesis and characterization of platinum phosphide nanoparticles as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide background details on the importance and applications of propylene, mechanisms of catalyst activity, thermodynamic constraints, kinetic factors, computational studies, or structure-activity relationships for propane dehydrogenation.
