 Upon reviewing the provided questions and answers, I have assessed that the answers do not contain relevant information to address the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation. The answers indicate the given literature focuses on platinum phosphide nanoparticles as catalysts in general, but does not provide details related to the propane dehydrogenation mechanisms, kinetics, thermodynamics, computational modeling, and structure-activity relationships asked about in the questions. 

Therefore, my response is:

※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※
