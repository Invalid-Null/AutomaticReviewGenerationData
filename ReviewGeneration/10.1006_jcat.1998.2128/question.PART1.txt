I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

The Role of Coke in Acetylene Hydrogenation on Pd/α-Al2O3
Abstract
The formation of coke and the influence of the coke on selectivity were investigated during hydrogenation of acetylene on supported palladium catalysts. It was found that the total amount of coke was not directly related to the increase in formation of undesired ethane. Instead, the surface coverage of hydrogen during the deactivation was found to be a crucial parameter. A catalyst deactivated at low hydrogen surface coverage showed a higher ethane selectivity than a sample deactivated at higher surface coverage of hydrogen when compared under the same reaction conditions. In contrast, the coke formation rate was found to increase with increased hydrogen surface coverage. The role of carbon monoxide was also investigated, and the impact on selectivity and coke formation was explained by the reduced surface coverage of hydrogen in the presence of carbon monoxide. The coke was characterized by temperature-programmed oxidation, and deconvolution of the obtained peaks was carried out using a power-law model.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <answer></answer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
