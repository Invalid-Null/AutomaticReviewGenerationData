[1] "STEM and EDX-mapping characterizations (Fig. 6) were undertaken to investigate the Pt and Ga dispersion on CAl2O3 and HdAl2O3."

[2] "On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 6(b), there is no discernable Pt particles in Pt/Ga/HdAl2O3, and the EDX-mapping results show that Pt, Ga, and Al elements distribute very homogeneously, indicating the well dispersion of Pt and Ga2O3 on HdAl2O3."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article employs STEM and EDX-mapping microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, it uses these techniques to investigate the dispersion of Pt and Ga on CAl2O3 and HdAl2O3 supports. The EDX-mapping results indicate homogeneous distribution of Pt, Ga, and Al on HdAl2O3, suggesting good dispersion of Pt and Ga2O3.
