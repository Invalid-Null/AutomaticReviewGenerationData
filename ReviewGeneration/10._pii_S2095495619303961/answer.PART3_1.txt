[1] "To investigate and further improve the synergistic function between Pt and Ga2O3 as well as to profoundly understand the dehydrogenation performance of Ga2O3-based catalysts, we tentatively modulated the interaction between Pt and Ga2O3 through tuning the coordination structure of Al3+ in Al2O3 supports through various preparation methods."

[2] "Characterization of the catalysts revealed that Al3+penta sites promoted the dispersion of platinum and gallium ions on the Al2O3 support, which facilitated the effective hydrogen spillover between Pt and Ga and generated hydrogen desorption from the active sites of Ga2O3."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses tuning the coordination structure of Al3+ in Al2O3 supports through various preparation methods to modulate the interaction between Pt and Ga2O3 and improve their synergistic function. Characterization showed Al3+penta sites promoted dispersion of Pt and Ga, facilitating hydrogen spillover between them.

[1] "STEM and EDX-mapping characterizations (Fig. 6) were undertaken to investigate the Pt and Ga dispersion on CAl2O3 and HdAl2O3."

[2] "On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 6(b), there is no discernable Pt particles in Pt/Ga/HdAl2O3, and the EDX-mapping results show that Pt, Ga, and Al elements distribute very homogeneously, indicating the well dispersion of Pt and Ga2O3 on HdAl2O3."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: The article employs STEM and EDX-mapping microscopy techniques to characterize metal-support interfaces in the propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It shows STEM images and EDX mapping of Pt/Ga on CAl2O3 and HdAl2O3, revealing homogeneous dispersion of Pt and Ga on HdAl2O3.
