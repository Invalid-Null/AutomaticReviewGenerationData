[1] "The effect of the Al2O3 structure on the performance of Pt/Ga/Al2O3 catalysts is investigated for the direct dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "The study unveils that the structure of Al3+ determines the bulk structure of catalysts, particularly a high content of coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ sites (penta-coordinated Al3+, denoted as Al3+penta) could lead to a remarkably improved dehydrogenation activity of the catalyst."  
[3] "At the same time, TPR results reveal that the presence of Pt facilitates the reduction of Ga2O3, likely due to the hydrogen spillover between the well dispersed Pt and Ga2O3, which consequently enhances the synergistic function between Pt and Ga2O3 in the dehydrogenation of propane."

<Answer>
 <quotes>
[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is one of the most important issues in chemical engineering industry due to the growing demand for propylene throughout the world." 
[2] "Ga2O3 is another typical non-precious metal oxide for dehydrogenation of light alkanes and has been investigated intensively."
[3] "Although substantial understanding of the catalytic mechanism has been gained and consequently catalytic performance improved, the limited resource of Pt and the environmental pollution from Cr still demand the search for alternative economic and eco-friendly catalysts."
[4] "Both bulk and supported Ga2O3 have been utilized as catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, and Ga2O3 supported on alumina seems the most common one among these catalysts."
[5] "A heterolytic dissociation reaction mechanism was proposed and the Lewis acid sites generated on the catalysts through the interaction of Ga2O3 with Al2O3 were assigned as the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[6] "It has been reported that the PDH performance of Ga/Al2O3 could be remarkably improved through the addition of trace amount of platinum (0.1 wt%) on the catalyst, whereas in absence of Ga2O3, the activity of 0.1 wt% Pt/Al2O3 is negligible."
[7] "Thus, Ga2O3 is supposed to be the active sites in the dehydrogenation process."
[8] "Therefore, it is significant to investigate the synergistic function mechanism between the Pt and Ga2O3 in the reaction for further improvement of the dehydrogenation performance via rational modification of the structure of the catalyst as well as the deep understanding of Ga2O3-catalyzed dehydrogenation mechanism."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates how the coordination structure of Al3+ affects the propane dehydrogenation performance of supported gallium oxide catalysts. It shows that a high content of penta-coordinated Al3+ sites leads to improved activity, likely by promoting Pt and Ga2O3 dispersion and enhancing hydrogen spillover between Pt and Ga2O3. The catalyst's activity stabilizes after 3 reaction-regeneration cycles.

Answer: 是的,该文研究了Al3+的配位结构如何影响载体氧化镓催化剂的丙烷脱氢性能。它表明五配位Al3+位的高含量可提高活性,这可能是由于促进Pt和Ga2O3的分散度,并增强Pt和Ga2O3之间的氢溢出。该催化剂的活性在3个反应-再生循环后稳定。

[2] "Wide studies indicated that the rate-determining step for the dehydrogenation of propane is the hydrogen transfer and desorption from the active sites on Ga2O3 catalysts."

[3] "The homogeneously dispersed platinum species likely facilitates the hydrogen transfer and desorption from Ga2O3 effectively via hydrogen spillover."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article proposes that Ga2O3 is the active site for propane dehydrogenation, and the rate-limiting step is hydrogen transfer and desorption from Ga2O3 sites. It suggests that well-dispersed Pt facilitates this hydrogen transfer/desorption via spillover, enhancing Ga2O3 dehydrogenation performance.
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,该文提出Ga2O3是丙烷脱氢的活性位,控制步骤是氢从Ga2O3位点的转移和解吸。它认为分散良好的Pt通过溢出促进这种氢的转移/解吸,增强了Ga2O3的脱氢性能。
</Chinese version answer>

<quotes>
[1] "The unsaturated Al3+penta sites tend to anchor the loaded ions via the oxygen bridge to achieve more stable Al3+octa coordinate state, which is likely the reason for the diminished Al3+penta sites and the increased Al3+octa sites upon Ga2O3 and Pt loading in Pt/Ga/HdAl2O3 and Pt/Ga/SgAl2O3."

[2] "Since Al3+penta sites have the strong tendency to bind the dopants to achieve the coordination-saturated state, it is reasonable to anticipate that a strong metal-support interaction in the catalysts could be generated on Al2O3 support with plenty amount of Al3+penta."

[3] "The EDX mapping images show that Pt particles prefer to deposit around Ga2O3 sites, and it is clearly seen that the distribution of Ga2O3 and Pt species is not uniform on Al2O3."

[4] "The EDX-mapping results show that Pt, Ga, and Al elements distribute very homogeneously, indicating the well dispersion of Pt and Ga2O3 on HdAl2O3."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects. It shows Al3+penta sites anchor Pt/Ga species to achieve stable octahedral coordination, causing decreased Al3+penta and increased Al3+octa. Al2O3 supports with more Al3+penta give stronger metal-support interactions and more homogeneous Pt/Ga dispersion. Non-uniform dispersion occurs on Al2O3 with less Al3+penta.
</English version answer> 

<Chinese version answer>
Answer: 是的,该文探讨了金属-载体界面效应。它显示Al3+penta位点锚定Pt/Ga物种以实现稳定的八面体配位,导致Al3+penta减少和Al3+octa增加。具有更多Al3+penta的Al2O3载体给出更强的金属-载体相互作用和更均匀的Pt/Ga分散。在Al3+penta较少的Al2O3上发生非均匀分散。
