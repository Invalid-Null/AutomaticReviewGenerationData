[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is one of the most important issues in chemical engineering industry due to the growing demand for propylene throughout the world." 
[2] "Ga2O3 is another typical non-precious metal oxide for dehydrogenation of light alkanes and has been investigated intensively."
[3] "Although substantial understanding of the catalytic mechanism has been gained and consequently catalytic performance improved, the limited resource of Pt and the environmental pollution from Cr still demand the search for alternative economic and eco-friendly catalysts."
[4] "Both bulk and supported Ga2O3 have been utilized as catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, and Ga2O3 supported on alumina seems the most common one among these catalysts."
[5] "A heterolytic dissociation reaction mechanism was proposed and the Lewis acid sites generated on the catalysts through the interaction of Ga2O3 with Al2O3 were assigned as the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[6] "It has been reported that the PDH performance of Ga/Al2O3 could be remarkably improved through the addition of trace amount of platinum (0.1 wt%) on the catalyst, whereas in absence of Ga2O3, the activity of 0.1 wt% Pt/Al2O3 is negligible."
[7] "Thus, Ga2O3 is supposed to be the active sites in the dehydrogenation process."
[8] "Therefore, it is significant to investigate the synergistic function mechanism between the Pt and Ga2O3 in the reaction for further improvement of the dehydrogenation performance via rational modification of the structure of the catalyst as well as the deep understanding of Ga2O3-catalyzed dehydrogenation mechanism."

8. Yes, the article evaluates the metal oxide Ga2O3 as a promising catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, providing data showing it has good activity when supported on Al2O3. The addition of trace Pt further improves performance. 

9. No, the article does not systematically investigate how properties like oxidation state, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties affect propane dehydrogenation over the Ga2O3 catalysts.

10. Yes, the article proposes a heterolytic dissociation mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over Ga2O3/Al2O3, with Lewis acid sites generated at the Ga2O3-Al2O3 interface acting as the active sites. No specific reaction intermediates are described.

11. Yes, the article explores metal-support interactions between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, showing Al3+ coordination structure affects Ga2O3 dispersion and Pt/Ga2O3 synergistic effects, modulating activity.

12. No, the article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic Pt, Pd or Ir catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.
