[1] "STEM and EDX-mapping characterizations (Fig. 6) were undertaken to investigate the Pt and Ga dispersion on CAl2O3 and HdAl2O3."

[2] "On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 6(b), there is no discernable Pt particles in Pt/Ga/HdAl2O3, and the EDX-mapping results show that Pt, Ga, and Al elements distribute very homogeneously, indicating the well dispersion of Pt and Ga2O3 on HdAl2O3."

</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article employs STEM and EDX mapping to characterize metal-support interfaces and dispersion in the Pt/Ga/Al2O3 catalysts. It shows Pt forms particles on CAl2O3 but is highly dispersed on HdAl2O3. 
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,该文献采用STEM和EDX元素映射来表征Pt/Ga/Al2O3催化剂中的金属-支持体界面和分散性。它显示Pt在CAl2O3上形成颗粒,但在HdAl2O3上高度分散。
