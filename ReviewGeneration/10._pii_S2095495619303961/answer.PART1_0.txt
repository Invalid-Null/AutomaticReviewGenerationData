[1] "The effect of the Al2O3 structure on the performance of Pt/Ga/Al2O3 catalysts is investigated for the direct dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "The study unveils that the structure of Al3+ determines the bulk structure of catalysts, particularly a high content of coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ sites (penta-coordinated Al3+, denoted as Al3+penta) could lead to a remarkably improved dehydrogenation activity of the catalyst."  
[3] "At the same time, TPR results reveal that the presence of Pt facilitates the reduction of Ga2O3, likely due to the hydrogen spillover between the well dispersed Pt and Ga2O3, which consequently enhances the synergistic function between Pt and Ga2O3 in the dehydrogenation of propane."

<English version answer>  
Answer: The article investigates how the coordination structure and oxidation state of Al3+ affects the propane dehydrogenation performance of Pt/Ga/Al2O3 catalysts. It finds that a high content of penta-coordinated Al3+ sites improves dehydrogenation activity, likely by enhancing Pt and Ga2O3 dispersion and Pt-Ga2O3 synergistic effects through hydrogen spillover.

Answer: The article explores metal-support interfacial effects in Pt/Ga/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It finds that a high content of penta-coordinated Al3+ sites in the Al2O3 support improves Pt and Ga2O3 dispersion and facilitates hydrogen spillover between Pt and Ga2O3, enhancing their synergistic effects and improving dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.
