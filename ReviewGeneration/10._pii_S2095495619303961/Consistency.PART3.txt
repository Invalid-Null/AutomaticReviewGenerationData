 Based on the provided correct answers and comparative answer files, I have compiled the following analysis of the consistency between each answer file and the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer.PART3_2.txt": "0%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I analyzed each answer file's responses question-by-question and compared them to the provided correct answers. The consistency ratio reflects my assessment of how consistent each response is with the correct answer for that question.
