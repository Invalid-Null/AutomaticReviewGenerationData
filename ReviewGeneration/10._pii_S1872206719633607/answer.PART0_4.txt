<quotes>
[1] "Recently, many studies have reported that nanocarbons could be directly used as metal-free catalysts for PDH and exhibit activities comparable to those of noble metal and/or metal oxide catalysts [5, 6, 7, 8, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142]."

[2] "Metal oxides, including VOx- and GaOx-based catalysts, are reported to be active for PDH, which represent the most promising alternatives to CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts."

[3] "Additionally, some other supported metal oxides (such as FeOx, CoOx, SnOx, ZnOx, and ZrO2-based catalysts) have been studied for PDH."
