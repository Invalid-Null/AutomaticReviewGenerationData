         [1] "Generally, isolated and/or unsaturated metal species are regarded as the active sites for PDH. However, they exhibit low stability and tend to aggregate into large particles, resulting in low stability and regenerability."

         [2] "Particularly, surface organometallic method is a very promising method of synthesis of highly stable PDH catalysts with isolated metal active sites."

         [3] "Owing to the well-defined structure of the active sites, the mechanisms of these catalysts can be easily identified."

         [4] "Improving the structural properties of CrOx-based catalysts is good for mass transport and can provide more accessible active sites."

         [5] "Improving the porosity of CrOx-based catalysts is a good way of improving their performance in PDH."  

         [6] "Ordered mesostructures of supports have the advantages of well-controlled morphologies, high surface areas, and rich pores, which are good for mass transportation and can provide more accessible active sites."

         [7] "To improve the interactions between Pt and the Al2O3 support, some novel and/or modified Al2O3 supports are used for the preparation of Pt-based catalysts."

         [8] "Nanocarbons (such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbons, and activated carbons) are green materials that have drawn much attention owing to their high thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties." 

         [9] "Improving the surface oxygenated functional groups is an efficient method to increase the catalytic activities of nanocarbon materials."

         [10] "Heteroatom-doped OMCs were prepared and used for PDH."

         The article discusses several catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion: 

         - Using surface organometallic chemistry methods to synthesize catalysts with isolated metal active sites, which improves stability and makes it easier to identify catalytic mechanisms due to the well-defined structure.  

         - Adding promoters like Sn, Zn, and In to modify the dispersion and electronic properties of active metal sites like Pt. 

         - Carefully controlling metal loading amounts and calcination temperatures to optimize dispersion. 

         - Using ordered mesoporous supports like mesoporous Al2O3 and mesoporous carbon to provide high surface areas and well-controlled morphologies for improved dispersion of active CrOx species.

         - Using modified Al2O3 supports to improve interactions with Pt species and dispersion of Pt nanoparticles. 

         - Utilizing nanocarbon supports like graphene and carbon nanotubes which have high surface areas and can disperse metal nanoparticles.

         - Increasing surface oxygen functional groups on nanocarbon supports to provide more dispersion sites. 

         - Doping nanocarbon supports with heteroatoms like N, P, B which affects dispersion properties.

         该文献讨论了几种催化剂制备方法,旨在优化活性相的分散:

         - 使用表面有机金属化学方法来合成具有隔离金属活性位点的催化剂,这提高了稳定性,并由于其结构良好的定义性,更容易识别催化机理。

         - 添加诸如Sn、Zn和In等助剂来调节Pt等活性金属位点的分散和电子性质。

         - 仔细控制金属负载量和煅烧温度以优化分散。

         - 使用有序介孔支撑体如介孔Al2O3和介孔碳,提供高比表面积和良好控制的形态,以改善CrOx活性物种的分散。 

         - 使用修改过的Al2O3支撑体来改善与Pt物种的相互作用和Pt纳米粒子的分散。

         - 利用比表面积高的碳纳米材料支撑体如石墨烯和碳纳米管,可以分散金属纳米粒子。

         - 增加碳纳米支撑体表面氧化官能团,提供更多的分散位点。

         - 在碳纳米支撑体掺杂N、P、B等杂原子,影响分散性能。
