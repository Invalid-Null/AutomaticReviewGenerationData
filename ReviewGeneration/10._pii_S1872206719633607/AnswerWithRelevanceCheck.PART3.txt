         [1] "Generally, isolated and/or unsaturated metal species are regarded as the active sites for PDH. However, they exhibit low stability and tend to aggregate into large particles, resulting in low stability and regenerability."
         [2] "Particularly, surface organometallic method is a very promising method of synthesis of highly stable PDH catalysts with isolated metal active sites."
         [3] "Owing to the well-defined structure of the active sites, the mechanisms of these catalysts can be easily identified."
         [4] "Improving the structural properties of CrOx-based catalysts is good for mass transport and can provide more accessible active sites." 
         [5] "Improving the porosity of CrOx-based catalysts is a good way of improving their performance in PDH."
         [6] "Ordered mesostructures of supports have the advantages of well-controlled morphologies, high surface areas, and rich pores, which are good for mass transportation and can provide more accessible active sites."
         [7] "To improve the interactions between Pt and the Al2O3 support, some novel and/or modified Al2O3 supports are used for the preparation of Pt-based catalysts." 
         [8] "Nanocarbons (such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbons, and activated carbons) are green materials that have drawn much attention owing to their high thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties."
         [9] "Improving the surface oxygenated functional groups is an efficient method to increase the catalytic activities of nanocarbon materials." 
         [10] "Heteroatom-doped OMCs were prepared and used for PDH."

         The article discusses several catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion, including: 
         - Using surface organometallic chemistry methods to synthesize catalysts with isolated metal active sites, improving stability and facilitating mechanistic identification.
         - Using ordered mesoporous supports like SBA-15, CMK-3, mesoporous Al2O3 and carbon to provide high surface area and porosity for better dispersion.
         - Modifying supports like Al2O3 to improve metal interactions and dispersion.  
         - Utilizing nanocarbon supports like graphene and doping them with heteroatoms to optimize dispersion properties.
         - Carefully controlling metal loading and calcination to optimize dispersion.

         该文献讨论了几种旨在优化活性相分散的催化剂制备方法,包括:
         - 使用表面有机金属化学方法来合成具有隔离金属活性位点的催化剂,提高了稳定性,并使机理识别更容易。
         - 使用有序介孔支撑体,如SBA-15、CMK-3、介孔Al2O3和碳,提供高比表面积和多孔性,以获得更好的分散。
         - 修改支撑体如Al2O3以改善金属的相互作用和分散。
         - 利用像石墨烯等碳纳米材料支撑体,并掺杂杂原子来优化分散性。
         - 仔细控制金属负载量和煅烧以优化分散。
