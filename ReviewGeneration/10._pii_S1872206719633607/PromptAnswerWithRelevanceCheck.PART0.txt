1. With growing demand for propylene and increasing production of propane from shale gas, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has drawn great attention and has been regarded as one of the most promising methods of propylene production.

2. Activation of the C-H bonds of propane is the most important step that determines the catalytic performance of PDH catalysts. 

3. Pt-based catalysts, CrOx-based catalysts, vanadium oxide-based catalysts, gallium oxide-based catalysts, and nanocarbons have been explored as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

4. Direct PDH is a thermodynamically limited highly endothermic process. A high reaction temperature is required to realize C-H bond cleavage.
