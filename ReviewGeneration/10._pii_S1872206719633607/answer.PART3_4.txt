<quotes>
[1] "Improving the structural properties of CrOx-based catalysts is good for mass transport and can provide more accessible active sites."

[2] "Improving the porosity of CrOx-based catalysts is a good way of improving their performance in PDH."  

[3] "Ordered mesostructures of supports have the advantages of well-controlled morphologies, high surface areas, and rich pores, which are good for mass transportation and can provide more accessible active sites."

[4] "To improve the interactions between Pt and the Al2O3 support, some novel and/or modified Al2O3 supports are used for the preparation of Pt-based catalysts."

[5] "Nanocarbons (such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbons, and activated carbons) are green materials that have drawn much attention owing to their high thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties." 

[6] "Improving the surface oxygenated functional groups is an efficient method to increase the catalytic activities of nanocarbon materials."

[7] "Heteroatom-doped OMCs were prepared and used for PDH."

3. The article discusses several catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion, including:

- Using ordered mesoporous supports like mesoporous Al2O3 and mesoporous carbon to provide high surface areas and well-controlled morphologies for improved dispersion of active CrOx species (Quotes 1-3). 

- Using modified Al2O3 supports to improve interactions with Pt species and dispersion of Pt nanoparticles (Quote 4).

- Utilizing nanocarbon supports like graphene and carbon nanotubes which have high surface areas and can disperse metal nanoparticles (Quote 5).

- Increasing surface oxygen functional groups on nanocarbon supports to provide more dispersion sites (Quote 6).

- Doping nanocarbon supports with heteroatoms like N, P, B which affects dispersion properties (Quote 7).
