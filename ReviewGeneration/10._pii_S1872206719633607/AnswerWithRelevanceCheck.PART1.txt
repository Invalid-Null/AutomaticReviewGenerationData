      [1] "Many studies have reported that nanocarbons (such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbons, and activated carbons) are green materials that have drawn much attention owing to their high thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties, which have been studied for decades in adsorption, separation, electrochemistry, and heterogeneous catalysis."

      [2] "In heterogeneous catalysis, nanocarbons impregnated with metal and/or metal oxides are usually used for electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and photoelectrocatalysis."

      [3] "Recently, many studies have reported that nanocarbons could be directly used as metal-free catalysts for PDH and exhibit activities comparable to those of noble metal and/or metal oxide catalysts."
    </Quotes>
    <English>
      The article evaluates nanocarbon catalysts like graphene, carbon nanotubes, and activated carbons for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing they exhibit comparable activity to metal and metal oxide catalysts, and discusses how their high thermal, mechanical and electrical properties make them promising PDH catalysts.

      [1] "In Pt-based catalysts, the size and structure of the Pt nanoparticles can greatly influence their activity, selectivity, stability, and the mechanism of the PDH process."

      [2] "On the other hand, large particles with Pt (111)-dominating crystal planes exhibited a high energy barrier for CH bond activation."
    </Quotes>
    <English>
      Yes, the article investigates how properties like Pt particle size and shape affect the performance of Pt catalysts. It states that Pt nanoparticle size and structure greatly influence the activity, selectivity, stability, and mechanism of propane dehydrogenation over Pt catalysts. Specifically, small Pt particles with (211)-dominating crystal planes have lower dehydrogenation energy barriers and higher activity, while large Pt particles with (111) planes have higher energy barriers.
