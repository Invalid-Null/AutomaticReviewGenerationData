1. With growing demand for propylene and increasing production of propane from shale gas, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has drawn great attention and has been regarded as one of the most promising methods of propylene production.

2. Activation of the C-H bonds of propane is the most important step that determines the catalytic performance of PDH catalysts. 

3. Pt-based catalysts, CrOx-based catalysts, vanadium oxide-based catalysts, gallium oxide-based catalysts, and nanocarbons have been explored as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

4. Direct PDH is a thermodynamically limited highly endothermic process. A high reaction temperature is required to realize C-H bond cleavage.

<English version answer>

1. The article provides background that propylene is an important chemical feedstock with growing demand, and propane dehydrogenation is an attractive route for propylene production from the increasing supplies of propane from shale gas. 

2. The article explains that catalysts can facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering the activation energy barrier for breaking propane's C-H bonds, which is the critical step.

3. The article introduces several major catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation, including supported metals like Pt, metal oxides like CrOx and VOx, and nanocarbon materials. 

4. The article notes that propane dehydrogenation is a thermodynamically limited, highly endothermic process that requires high reaction temperatures of 550-700°C to achieve C-H bond cleavage.

5. The article does not describe any DFT calculation efforts.

6. The article does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation.

7. The article does not identify any quantitative structure-activity relationships or descriptors correlating catalyst properties to performance.
