 Unfortunately, the literature provided does not contain any relevant quotes or information to answer the specific questions asked. The paper is a broad review of different catalyst materials and methods for propane dehydrogenation, but does not go into details about zeolite supports, in situ characterization, advanced microscopy, X-ray techniques, or reactor types as asked in the questions. Therefore, my responses are as follows:
