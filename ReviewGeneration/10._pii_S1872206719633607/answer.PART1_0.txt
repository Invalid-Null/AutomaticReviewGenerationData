[1] "Many studies have reported that nanocarbons (such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbons, and activated carbons) are green materials that have drawn much attention owing to their high thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties, which have been studied for decades in adsorption, separation, electrochemistry, and heterogeneous catalysis."

[2] "In heterogeneous catalysis, nanocarbons impregnated with metal and/or metal oxides are usually used for electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and photoelectrocatalysis." 

[3] "Recently, many studies have reported that nanocarbons could be directly used as metal-free catalysts for PDH and exhibit activities comparable to those of noble metal and/or metal oxide catalysts."

<English version answer>

1.The article does evaluate nanocarbon catalysts like graphene, carbon nanotubes, and activated carbons for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing they exhibit comparable activity to metal and metal oxide catalysts, and discusses how their high thermal, mechanical and electrical properties make them promising PDH catalysts.  

2.The article does not specifically investigate tuning oxidation states, oxygen mobility, and acid-base properties of metal oxides for propane dehydrogenation.

3.The article does not propose detailed mechanistic scenarios for propane dehydrogenation over metal oxide catalysts.

4.The article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects in metal oxide catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

5.The article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir for propane dehydrogenation.

6.The article does not investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts.

7.The article does not propose mechanistic reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over supported metal catalysts.
