<quotes>
[1] "Further, more detailed, systematic, and scientific studies on the roles of promoters, interactions between the active sites and supports, acidity of the support, and structural and electronic properties of CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts are highly desired."

[2] "Future research should focus on (i) developing new efficient synthesis methods to improve the catalyst stability, (ii) revealing the active sites and catalytic mechanisms, (iii) identifying the interplay between catalyst deactivation and regeneration, and (iv) developing in situ and/or operando spectroscopy techniques to monitor the changes occurring in the catalysts (in terms of structure and surface properties) during the PDH process."
