<quotes>
[1] "Up to now, the two widely used crafts are Catofin (CrOx-based catalysts) and Oleflex (Pt-based catalysts) technologies."

[2] "Supported vanadium oxides (VOx) are reported to be one of the most promising alternative catalysts to Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts in PDH, owing to their low price and high catalytic activity."  

[3] "Gallium oxide (GaOx)-based catalysts have been studied for PDH reaction for years."

[4] "Nanocarbons (such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, mesoporous carbons, and activated carbons) are green materials that have drawn much attention owing to their high thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties, which have been studied for decades in adsorption, separation, electrochemistry, and heterogeneous catalysis."
