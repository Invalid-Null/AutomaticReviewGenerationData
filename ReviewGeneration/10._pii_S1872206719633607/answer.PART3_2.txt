<quotes>

[1] "Generally, isolated and/or unsaturated metal species are regarded as the active sites for PDH. However, they exhibit low stability and tend to aggregate into large particles, resulting in low stability and regenerability."

[2] "Particularly, surface organometallic method is a very promising method of synthesis of highly stable PDH catalysts with isolated metal active sites."

[3] "Owing to the well-defined structure of the active sites, the mechanisms of these catalysts can be easily identified."

3. The article discusses several catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion:

- Using surface organometallic chemistry methods to synthesize catalysts with isolated metal active sites, which improves stability and makes it easier to identify catalytic mechanisms due to the well-defined structure. 

- Adding promoters like Sn, Zn, and In to modify the dispersion and electronic properties of active metal sites like Pt.

- Carefully controlling metal loading amounts and calcination temperatures to optimize dispersion.

[1] "Furthermore, the addition of promoters (such as Sn, In, Zn, Cu, Mn, and Fe) can strongly affect the performances of Pt-based catalysts in PDH. Among these promoters, Sn, Zn, and In are the ones that are widely used for Pt catalysts. Sn and Zn can hinder side reactions such as isomerization and coke formation during alkane dehydrogenation, whereas In can prevent side reactions by poisoning the Brnsted acid sites; the formation of Pt-In alloy has electronic and geometric effects on the Pt species, which decrease the coke formation."
