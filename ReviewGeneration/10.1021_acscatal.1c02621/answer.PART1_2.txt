1. The ZrGa catalysts with different molar ratios of Zr and Ga were impregnated into an alumina or an aluminosilicate support (Tables S1 and S2 and Figures S1 and S2). 

2. When ZrO2/SIRAL10 was used as the catalyst, only 1.8% of propane was converted with a low selectivity (74.3%). Both the conversion of propane and the selectivity of propylene increased significantly with the addition of Ga2O3 (Figure 2a). The propane conversion reached 50.1% at a propylene selectivity of 95.1% for a Zr/Ga molar ratio of 0.26/1 (e.g., Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10).

3. Moreover, home-made PtSn and CrOx/Al2O3 were used as another reference (Figures S10S13 and Table S5). It was found that Zr0.26Ga1/SIR AL 10 yielded a larger improvement of the PDH performance with respect to PtSn(I) and 20 wt % CrOx/Al2O3 under different temperatures (Figure 3ac).

4.  Similar superior PDH properties of Zr0.26Ga1 with respect to PtSn(I) and 20 wt % CrOx/Al2O3 were observed when PDH was performed under different weight hourly space velocities (WHSVs) (Figures S14). 

5. Note that the Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10 catalyst requires only calcination in air to remove the deposited coke, while the industrial PtSn catalyst requires additional oxychlorination. (4,13) This is expected to significantly reduce the cost of PDH when using Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10 [in addition to the reduction due to the much cheaper cost of Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10 with respect to PtSn(I)].

6. DFT calculations show that 4-coordinated Zr atoms at the ZrO2Ga2O3 interface are the energetically favorable sites for the adsorption of propane molecules. The subsequent successive CH bond activations are then catalyzed by the low-coordinated (4-coordinated) Zr atoms. Ga2O3 promotes the diffusion of dissociated hydrogen atoms from vacancies to regenerate the low-coordinated Zr atoms. 

7. We speculate that the active sites of defective ZrO2 might be poisoned during dehydrogenation in the absence of promoters. Herein, we demonstrate an efficient promoter (Ga2O3) for stabilizing the oxygen vacancies in ZrO2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that 4-coordinated Zr atoms at the ZrO2Ga2O3 interface are the energetically favorable sites for the adsorption of propane molecules.  

8. The ZrGa system indicates that one can design a binary component catalyst in which Ga2O3 suppresses poisoning and coke formation. To generalize this strategy and confirm it to components different than Zr, we first checked the PDH performance and coke formation of single-component materials. Ga2O3 obviously has a very low coke formation rate, orders of magnitude lower than that of the other catalysts (Table S14). The PDH performance of the single component catalysts is very low (high coke rate formation leading to low yield), except Ga2O3 (low coke rate formation and medium yield). The addition of Ga2O3 to the other metallic components (Fe, Y, Ni, Co, W, Mo, and Zr) indeed suppresses coke formation and enhances PDH performance (Figures S38S43 and Tables S15S20).

1. Yes, the article evaluates Cr2O3/Al2O3 and PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It provides data showing that the Zr0.26Ga1 catalyst has higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to Cr2O3/Al2O3 and PtSn catalysts under various conditions. 

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning the molar ratio of Zr to Ga affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It reveals that adding Ga2O3 to ZrO2 significantly increases both propane conversion and propylene selectivity, with the optimal Zr/Ga ratio being 0.26/1.

3. No, the article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts like Pt, Pd or Ir for propane dehydrogenation.

4. No, the article does not investigate how properties like metal particle size, shape, and support interactions affect the performance of supported metal catalysts. 

5. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario where low-coordinated Zr sites at the ZrO2-Ga2O3 interface activate C-H bonds in propane, while Ga2O3 promotes hydrogen removal to prevent poisoning of active sites.

6. Yes, the article explores metal-support interfacial effects, showing Ga2O3 suppresses coke formation and poisoning of oxygen vacancy sites in supported ZrO2, enhancing propane dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

7. No, the article does not propose mechanistic reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over supported metal catalysts.
