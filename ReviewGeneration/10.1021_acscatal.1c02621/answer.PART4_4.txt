<quotes>

[1] "Despite the experimental observation and theoretical prediction of oxygen vacancies in ZrO2 for PDH, the intrinsic mechanism of the effects of oxygen vacancies on PDH performance has not been completely understood yet, and ZrO2 without promoters generally displays poor activity toward the direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[2] "We anticipate this work may shed light on both the fundamental research of catalysis and the chemical industry."
