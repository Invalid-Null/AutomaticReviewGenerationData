[1] "All catalysts were prepared using the wet impregnation method, and the loading percentage of the catalyst was kept at 4% in weight."

[2] "To prepare Zr0.26Ga1, for instance, stoichiometric Zr(NO3)4·5H2O and Ga(NO3)3 were dissolved in deionized water, and then the solution was dropwise added into the support to form a slurry."

[3] "After that, the slurry was aged at 60 °C for 1 h, followed by drying at 100 °C for 12 h." 

[4] "The obtained powder was calcinated in air under 800 °C for 2 h."
