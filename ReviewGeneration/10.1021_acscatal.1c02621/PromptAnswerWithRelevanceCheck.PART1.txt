1. The ZrGa catalysts with different molar ratios of Zr and Ga were impregnated into an alumina or an aluminosilicate support (Tables S1 and S2 and Figures S1 and S2). 

2. When ZrO2/SIRAL10 was used as the catalyst, only 1.8% of propane was converted with a low selectivity (74.3%). Both the conversion of propane and the selectivity of propylene increased significantly with the addition of Ga2O3 (Figure 2a). The propane conversion reached 50.1% at a propylene selectivity of 95.1% for a Zr/Ga molar ratio of 0.26/1 (e.g., Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10).

3. Moreover, home-made PtSn and CrOx/Al2O3 were used as another reference (Figures S10S13 and Table S5). It was found that Zr0.26Ga1/SIR AL 10 yielded a larger improvement of the PDH performance with respect to PtSn(I) and 20 wt % CrOx/Al2O3 under different temperatures (Figure 3ac).

4.  Similar superior PDH properties of Zr0.26Ga1 with respect to PtSn(I) and 20 wt % CrOx/Al2O3 were observed when PDH was performed under different weight hourly space velocities (WHSVs) (Figures S14). 

5. Note that the Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10 catalyst requires only calcination in air to remove the deposited coke, while the industrial PtSn catalyst requires additional oxychlorination. (4,13) This is expected to significantly reduce the cost of PDH when using Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10 [in addition to the reduction due to the much cheaper cost of Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10 with respect to PtSn(I)].

6. DFT calculations show that 4-coordinated Zr atoms at the ZrO2Ga2O3 interface are the energetically favorable sites for the adsorption of propane molecules. The subsequent successive CH bond activations are then catalyzed by the low-coordinated (4-coordinated) Zr atoms. Ga2O3 promotes the diffusion of dissociated hydrogen atoms from vacancies to regenerate the low-coordinated Zr atoms. 

7. We speculate that the active sites of defective ZrO2 might be poisoned during dehydrogenation in the absence of promoters. Herein, we demonstrate an efficient promoter (Ga2O3) for stabilizing the oxygen vacancies in ZrO2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that 4-coordinated Zr atoms at the ZrO2Ga2O3 interface are the energetically favorable sites for the adsorption of propane molecules.  

8. The ZrGa system indicates that one can design a binary component catalyst in which Ga2O3 suppresses poisoning and coke formation. To generalize this strategy and confirm it to components different than Zr, we first checked the PDH performance and coke formation of single-component materials. Ga2O3 obviously has a very low coke formation rate, orders of magnitude lower than that of the other catalysts (Table S14). The PDH performance of the single component catalysts is very low (high coke rate formation leading to low yield), except Ga2O3 (low coke rate formation and medium yield). The addition of Ga2O3 to the other metallic components (Fe, Y, Ni, Co, W, Mo, and Zr) indeed suppresses coke formation and enhances PDH performance (Figures S38S43 and Tables S15S20).

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning the molar ratio of Zr to Ga affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It reveals that adding Ga2O3 to ZrO2 significantly increases both propane conversion and propylene selectivity, with the optimal Zr/Ga ratio being 0.26/1.

1. The article evaluates ZrO2, Ga2O3, PtSn, and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. ZrO2 by itself shows low propane conversion (1.8%) and selectivity (74.3%), while adding Ga2O3 significantly improves conversion to 50.1% and selectivity to 95.1% for the optimal Zr0.26Ga1 catalyst. The Zr0.26Ga1 catalyst also outperforms PtSn and CrOx/Al2O3 references.

2. The article investigates how the ratio of Zr to Ga affects propane dehydrogenation performance. Increasing Ga content first improves activity and selectivity up to an optimal Zr/Ga ratio, but too much Ga leads to decreasing performance.

3. The article proposes a mechanistic scenario where ZrO2 provides active sites for C-H bond activation and dehydrogenation, while Ga2O3 facilitates removal of dissociated hydrogen atoms to prevent poisoning of active sites. The synergy between ZrO2 and Ga2O3 leads to improved propane dehydrogenation.

[1] "The scission of CH bonds is thus much faster than that of CC bonds, resulting in the propyl radical as the major product. Note that the dissociated H atom is adsorbed on the nearby O lattice atom [final state (FS) in Figure 5b] and has to be removed to allow further CH activation (note that it is absent in the IS of Figure 5c,d)."

[2] "The second CH activation may occur either at the first carbon atom or at the second (central) carbon atom of the propyl radical. The calculated energy profiles show that the dissociation of H atom from the second carbon atom of the propyl group to produce the propylene molecule is a highly exothermic reaction, with a very small activation barrier of 0.10 eV and a large energy drop of 1.87 eV." 

[3] "By contrast, the CH activation on the first carbon atom is an endothermic reaction with a much larger energy barrier of 0.91 eV. Again, the dissociated H atom generated via the second CH activation is trapped by the nearby O lattice atom and must be removed to facilitate further CH activation."

<English version answer>

10. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario where propane first undergoes CH bond cleavage to form a propyl radical, with subsequent dehydrogenation at the central carbon to produce propylene. Dissociated H atoms can poison active sites, requiring removal for continued reaction. This reveals specific reaction steps, intermediates, and the importance of active site desorption.
