[1] "Moreover, home-made PtSn and CrOx/Al2O3 were used as another reference (Figures S10S13 and Table S5). It was found that Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL 10 yielded a larger improvement of the PDH performance with respect to PtSn(I) and 20 wt % CrOx/Al2O3 under different temperatures (Figure 3ac)."

[2] "Similar superior PDH properties of Zr0.26Ga1 with respect to PtSn(I) and 20 wt % CrOx/Al2O3 were observed when PDH was performed under different weight hourly space velocities (WHSVs) (Figures S14)."

[3] "Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10 initiated a propylene STY of 1.61 kg kgCat.1•h1, while PtSn(I) and 20 wt % CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts produced lower propylene STYs (1.33 kg kgCat.1 h1 for PtSn(I) and 1.04 kg kgCat.1 h1 for 20 wt % CrOx/Al2O3) when the temperature and WHSV were 600 C and 3.5 h1, respectively (Figure 3c)."

8. Yes, the article evaluates PtSn, CrOx/Al2O3, and Ga2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. It shows that Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10 has superior propane dehydrogenation performance compared to PtSn(I) and CrOx/Al2O3 under different temperatures and space velocities, with higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity.

8. 是的,文章评估了PtSn、CrOx/Al2O3和Ga2O3催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。它显示Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10相比PtSn(I)和CrOx/Al2O3在不同温度和空速下具有更优异的丙烷脱氢性能,具有更高的丙烷转换率和丙烯选择性。

[1] "The molar ratio of Zr/Ga was found critical to PDH performance (Figure 2a,b). When ZrO2/SIRAL10 was used as the catalyst, only 1.8% of propane was converted with a low selectivity (74.3%). Both the conversion of propane and the selectivity of propylene increased significantly with the addition of Ga2O3 (Figure 2a)." 

[2] "The propane conversion reached 50.1% at a propylene selectivity of 95.1% for a Zr/Ga molar ratio of 0.26/1 (e.g., Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10)."

[3] "A further increase of the amount of Ga2O3 led to a decrease of the catalytic activity."

[4] "The propylene yield showed a similar dependence on the ratio of Zr/Ga. As depicted in Figure 2b, the space time yield (STY) of propylene was 0.045 kg kgCat.1 h1 for ZrO2/SIRAL10, which increased to 1.61 kg•kgCat.1 h1 for the optimized Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10."

9. Yes, the article investigates how tuning the Zr/Ga ratio affects propane dehydrogenation performance. It shows that an optimal Zr/Ga molar ratio of 0.26/1 gives the highest propane conversion of 50.1% and propylene selectivity of 95.1%. Both lower and higher Ga content decrease performance. This demonstrates that balancing Zr and Ga oxidation states and acid-base properties is critical.

9. 是的,文章研究了调节Zr/Ga比例如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。它显示最佳的Zr/Ga比例为0.26/1时,可以达到最高的丙烷转化率50.1%和丙烯选择性95.1%。Ga含量过低和过高都会降低性能。这表明平衡Zr和Ga的氧化态和酸碱性是关键的。

[1] "The scission of CH bonds is thus much faster than that of CC bonds, resulting in the propyl radical as the major product. Note that the dissociated H atom is adsorbed on the nearby O lattice atom [final state (FS) in Figure 5b] and has to be removed to allow further CH activation (note that it is absent in the IS of Figure 5c,d)."

[2] "The second CH activation may occur either at the first carbon atom or at the second (central) carbon atom of the propyl radical. The calculated energy profiles show that the dissociation of H atom from the second carbon atom of the propyl group to produce the propylene molecule is a highly exothermic reaction, with a very small activation barrier of 0.10 eV and a large energy drop of 1.87 eV." 

[3] "By contrast, the CH activation on the first carbon atom is an endothermic reaction with a much larger energy barrier of 0.91 eV. Again, the dissociated H atom generated via the second CH activation is trapped by the nearby O lattice atom and must be removed to facilitate further CH activation."

10. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario where propane first undergoes CH bond cleavage to form a propyl radical, with subsequent dehydrogenation at the central carbon to produce propylene. Dissociated H atoms can poison active sites, requiring removal for continued reaction. This reveals specific reaction steps, intermediates, and the importance of active site desorption.

10. 是的,文章提出了一个机理,丙烷先经历CH键断裂形成丙基自由基,随后在中心碳上脱氢生成丙烯。解离的氢原子会毒化活性位点,需要去除才能继续反应。这揭示了具体的反应步骤、中间体以及活性位点解吸的重要性。
