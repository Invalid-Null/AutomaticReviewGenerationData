[1] "ZrO2 with oxygen vacancies has recently been regarded as a promising catalyst for the direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

[2] "It has been widely reported that H2 treatment will produce oxygen vacancies in ZrO2, resulting in the formation of low-coordinated Zr active sites for significantly enhancing the dehydrogenation activity."

[3] "Despite the experimental observation and theoretical prediction of oxygen vacancies in ZrO2 for PDH, the intrinsic mechanism of the effects of oxygen vacancies on PDH performance has not been completely understood yet, and ZrO2 without promoters generally displays poor activity toward the direct dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article explains how catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation by lowering activation energy barriers through mechanisms like the creation of oxygen vacancies and low-coordinated Zr active sites in ZrO2. However, it also notes that the intrinsic mechanisms connecting oxygen vacancies to improved PDH performance are not fully understood.

[1] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the reaction pathway of the selective dehydrogenation of propane molecules at the ZrO2-Ga2O3 interface and at the ZrO2 and Ga2O3 surfaces."

[2] "The calculations refer to the different physicalchemical aspects relevant to the dehydrogenation process which include (i) the nature of the surface and the different activation sites involved, (ii) the adsorption energies of the different species participating (propane, propylene, dissociated H, and intermediate radicals), and (iii) the CH and CC activation barriers at the different stages of the dehydrogenation process."

[3] "We first studied the PDH process at the ZrO2-Ga2O3 interface which was modeled with an adsorbed Zr4O8 cluster on the Ga2O3(100) surface [a simple configuration which we assume to be sufficient to describe the PDH properties since they are determined (as a first order approximation) by the atoms in the neighborhood of the active site]."

[4] "Additional DFT calculations probed the PDH activity of Ga2O3." 

[5] "Additionally, DFT calculations were also used to investigate the pure ZrO2 system."
