1. Ga2O3/SIRAL10 was evaluated as a promising metal oxide catalyst for PDH. In situ IR results show that pure Ga2O3/SIRAL10 has a small peak corresponding to propylene, indicating it is active for PDH. 

2. The addition of Ga2O3 to ZrO2 significantly enhanced the PDH performance. The optimized Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10 catalyst exhibited 50.1% propane conversion and 95.1% propylene selectivity.

3. PtSn catalyst provided by UOP was used as a reference. Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10 yielded a larger improvement of PDH performance compared to the industrial PtSn catalyst. 

4. Home-made CrOx/Al2O3 was also evaluated. Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10 presented higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared to 20 wt% CrOx/Al2O3.

1. Yes, the article evaluates Ga2O3 and Pt-Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Ga2O3 showed some activity, while adding Ga2O3 to ZrO2 significantly boosted performance. Industrial PtSn and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts were tested for comparison, with the optimized ZrGa catalyst showing better activity.

2. Yes, the article investigates how tuning the Zr/Ga ratio affects performance. Adding Ga2O3 to ZrO2 greatly increased conversion and selectivity, with an optimal Zr/Ga ratio of 0.26/1. 

3. Yes, the article proposes a mechanistic scenario where ZrO2 provides active sites but is prone to poisoning, while Ga2O3 facilitates hydrogen removal to regenerate the active sites. The synergy between ZrO2 and Ga2O3 leads to high activity.

4. No, the article does not significantly explore metal-support effects. The focus is on the ZrO2-Ga2O3 interaction.

5. No, the article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts. The focus is on metal oxide catalysts.

6. No, the article does not investigate particle size, shape or support effects for supported metals.

7. No, the article does not propose mechanistic pathways over supported metal catalysts.
