[1] "All catalysts were prepared using the wet impregnation method, and the loading percentage of the catalyst was kept at 4% in weight."

[2] "To prepare Zr0.26Ga1, for instance, stoichiometric Zr(NO3)4·5H2O and Ga(NO3)3 were dissolved in deionized water, and then the solution was dropwise added into the support to form a slurry."

[3] "After that, the slurry was aged at 60 °C for 1 h, followed by drying at 100 °C for 12 h." 

[4] "The obtained powder was calcinated in air under 800 °C for 2 h."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article investigates catalyst preparation methods aimed at optimizing active phase dispersion. It discusses wet impregnation methods to prepare the ZrGa catalysts by dissolving metal precursors in water, adding them to the support, aging, drying, and calcinating to achieve good dispersion of the active components on the support.

[1] "In situ IR spectra for PDH on ZrO2 (b), Ga2O3 (c), and Zr0.26Ga1 catalysts (d). In situ IR measurements were performed in the mixture of C3H8, N2, and H2." 

[2] "IR conditions: Vtotal = 3 mL, Ptotal = 0.12 MPa, T = 600 °C, and m(Zr0.26Ga1) = 50 mg."

[3] "We used in situ infrared (IR) spectrometry to monitor the PDH performance over ZrO2/SIRAL10, Ga2O3/SIRAL10, and Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10 catalysts."

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article utilizes in-situ IR spectroscopy to study working propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It examines the PDH performance of ZrO2, Ga2O3, and ZrGa catalysts using in-situ IR under propane dehydrogenation conditions. This provides insights into the superior PDH activity of the ZrGa composite catalyst compared to its individual components.

[1] "XANES further substantiated this observation showing a much stronger intensity change of Zr K-edge than Ga K-edge in the H2-treated Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10 sample (Figure S5)."

[2] "EXAFS confirmed the lack of a complete second shell around Zr in the catalyst and the decrease of ZrO coordination number after H2 treatment (Figure S6 and Table S3)."
</quotes>

<English version answer>
Answer: Yes, the article uses X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS) to probe oxidation state changes during propane dehydrogenation catalysis. It shows that H2 treatment generates more oxygen vacancies and unsaturated Zr sites in the ZrO2 component, as evidenced by changes in the Zr K-edge XANES/EXAFS spectra before and after H2 treatment. 
</English version answer>

<Chinese version answer>
答:是的,本文使用X射线吸收谱技术(XANES 和 EXAFS)来探测丙烷脱氢催化过程中的氧化态变化。结果显示,H2处理在ZrO2组分中产生了更多的氧空位和非饱和Zr位点,这可以通过H2处理前后Zr K边XANES/EXAFS谱的变化得以证实。
