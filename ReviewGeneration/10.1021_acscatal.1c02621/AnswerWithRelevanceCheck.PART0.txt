         [1] "Recently, ZrO2 has been deemed as a promising catalyst for PDH. It has been widely reported that H2 treatment will produce oxygen vacancies in ZrO2, resulting in the formation of low-coordinated Zr active sites for significantly enhancing the dehydrogenation activity."
         [2] "The conversion of light alkanes to olefins (e.g., ethylene, propylene, or butylene) is crucial to the chemical industry."

      <English>
         The article explains that catalysts like ZrO2 with oxygen vacancies can facilitate propane dehydrogenation by providing low-coordinated Zr active sites that lower the activation energy barriers. The conversion of alkanes to olefins through dehydrogenation is described as crucial to the chemical industry.
