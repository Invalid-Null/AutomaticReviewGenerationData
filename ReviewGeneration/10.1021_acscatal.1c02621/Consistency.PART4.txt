I carefully compared each answer file's responses to the correct answers provided and calculated the consistency ratios. The keys in the JSON represent the question numbers, and the values show the percentage consistency for each file's answer. 0% means completely inconsistent, 100% means completely consistent. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
