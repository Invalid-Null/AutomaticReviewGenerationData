1. ZrO2/SIRAL10 was used as the catalyst, only 1.8% of propane was converted with a low selectivity (74.3%). 

2. Both the conversion of propane and the selectivity of propylene increased significantly with the addition of Ga2O3. The propane conversion reached 50.1% at a propylene selectivity of 95.1% for a Zr/Ga molar ratio of 0.26/1 (e.g., Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10).

3. A further increase of the amount of Ga2O3 led to a decrease of the catalytic activity. 

4. Home-made PtSn and CrOx/Al2O3 were used as another reference. It was found that Zr0.26Ga1/SIRAL10 yielded a larger improvement of the PDH performance with respect to PtSn(I) and 20 wt % CrOx/Al2O3 under different temperatures.

<English version answer>

1. The article evaluates ZrO2, Ga2O3, PtSn, and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. ZrO2 by itself shows low propane conversion (1.8%) and selectivity (74.3%), while adding Ga2O3 significantly improves conversion to 50.1% and selectivity to 95.1% for the optimal Zr0.26Ga1 catalyst. The Zr0.26Ga1 catalyst also outperforms PtSn and CrOx/Al2O3 references.

2. The article investigates how the ratio of Zr to Ga affects propane dehydrogenation performance. Increasing Ga content first improves activity and selectivity up to an optimal Zr/Ga ratio, but too much Ga leads to decreasing performance.

3. The article proposes a mechanistic scenario where ZrO2 provides active sites for C-H bond activation and dehydrogenation, while Ga2O3 facilitates removal of dissociated hydrogen atoms to prevent poisoning of active sites. The synergy between ZrO2 and Ga2O3 leads to improved propane dehydrogenation.  

4. The article does not explore metal-support interfacial effects.

5. The article does not evaluate any supported mono-metallic catalysts.

6. The article does not investigate properties like metal particle size, shape etc. for supported metal catalysts. 

7. The article does not propose mechanistic pathways for supported metal catalysts.

1. 该文章评估了ZrO2、Ga2O3、PtSn和CrOx/Al2O3等催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。ZrO2本身的丙烷转化率较低(1.8%)和选择性较低(74.3%),而添加Ga2O3可显著提高转化率至50.1%和选择性至95.1%对于优化的Zr0.26Ga1催化剂。Zr0.26Ga1催化剂也优于PtSn和CrOx/Al2O3参考催化剂。

2. 该文章研究了Zr与Ga的比例如何影响丙烷脱氢性能。 Ga含量的增加先提高了活性和选择性,直到达到优化的Zr/Ga比例,但Ga过量会导致性能下降。

3. 该文章提出了一个机理场景,其中ZrO2提供了C-H键激活和脱氢的活性位点,而Ga2O3有助于消除解离的氢原子以防止活性位点中毒。ZrO2和Ga2O3之间的协同作用导致丙烷脱氢性能的改进。

4. 该文章没有探讨金属支持体间相互作用效应。

5. 该文章没有评估任何受支持的单金属催化剂。

6. 该文章没有研究像金属粒子大小、形状等对受支持金属催化剂的影响。

7. 该文章没有提出受支持金属催化剂的机理途径。
