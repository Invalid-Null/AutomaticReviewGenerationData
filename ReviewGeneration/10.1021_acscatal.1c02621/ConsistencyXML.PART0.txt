I analyzed the content from each answer file and compared it to the correct answers to determine consistency percentages for each question. Answers that matched the key points from the correct answers were considered fully consistent (100%), while completely irrelevant or contradictory answers were 0% consistent. Partially relevant answers received intermediate percentages based on their coverage of the expected key points.
