 Here is the comparison of the answer files against the correct answers:

```json
{
  "1": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  "2": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  "3": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  "4": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  "5": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  "6": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"},
  "7": {"answer.PART3_0.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_1.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_2.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_3.txt": "100%", "answer.PART3_4.txt": "100%"}
}
```

I compared each answer file's response for each question against the correct answer provided. Since all the answer files consistently stated that the literature did not contain information relevant to the questions asked about propane dehydrogenation, I marked each file as having 100% consistency with the correct answers.
