 Unfortunately there are no relevant quotes from the given literature that directly address the specific questions asked about propane dehydrogenation. The literature focuses on ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and does not discuss propane dehydrogenation.

<English version answer>

1. The literature does not provide any background information on propane dehydrogenation specifically. It focuses entirely on ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

2. The literature does not explain how catalysts facilitate propane dehydrogenation. It only discusses ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. 

3. The literature does not introduce any catalyst classes explored for propane dehydrogenation. It only looks at IrO2 for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

4. The literature does not discuss thermodynamic or kinetic factors involved in propane dehydrogenation. It only examines these for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

5. The literature does not apply DFT calculations to study propane dehydrogenation. DFT is only used to study ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

6. The literature does not present any microkinetic modeling of propane dehydrogenation. Modeling only covers ethane oxidative dehydrogenation. 

7. The literature does not identify any descriptors correlating catalyst properties to propane dehydrogenation performance. It only looks at ethane oxidative dehydrogenation.

1. 文献没有提供任何关于丙烷脱氢的背景信息。它完全集中在乙烷氧化脱氢上。

2. 文献没有解释催化剂如何促进丙烷脱氢。它只讨论了乙烷氧化脱氢。

3. 文献没有介绍任何已被探索用于丙烷脱氢的催化剂类别。它只查看IrO2用于乙烷氧化脱氢。

4. 文献没有讨论丙烷脱氢中涉及的热力学或动力学因素。它只检查这些对乙烷氧化脱氢。

5. 文献没有应用DFT计算来研究丙烷脱氢机制。DFT仅用于研究乙烷氧化脱氢。

6. 文献没有呈现任何丙烷脱氢的微观动力学建模。建模仅涵盖乙烷氧化脱氢。

7. 文献没有确定任何描述催化剂性能与丙烷脱氢性能之间关系的描述符。它只看乙烷氧化脱氢。
