Unraveling the Surface State Evolution of IrO2 in Ethane Chemical Looping Oxidative Dehydrogenation

Abstract
Based on the advantages of favorable thermodynamics and coking resistance of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation and the challenge of low ethylene selectivity, chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) over the IrO2 catalyst was examined, including the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes. The stoichiometric S-IrO2 and reduced R-IrO2 catalysts as two extreme states of the IrO2 surface structure with dynamic changes were considered. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations showed that the mechanisms of ethane dehydrogenation over S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 catalysts were quite different. Over the S-IrO2 catalyst, ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to C2H4(g) with H2O(g), CO(g), and CO2(g) taking away surface lattice oxygen, followed by lattice oxygen migration from the bulk to the surface, leads to the reduction of the S-IrO2 catalyst. Over the R-IrO2 catalyst, ethane directly dehydrogenates to C2H4(g) and H2(g). Furthermore, the oxidation degree in the regeneration process is greater than the Ov concentration in the dehydrogenation process, which can easily achieve oxygen replenishment in the regeneration process. More importantly, the IrO2 catalyst can be neither completely reduced in the dehydrogenation process nor completely oxidized in the regeneration process, both S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 simultaneously exist for the IrO2 catalyst, and both 750 K and 0.8 bar C2H6(g) pressure were obtained to be the optimal reaction conditions; thus, for ethane CL-ODH over the IrO2 catalyst, the proposed mechanism starts from the oxidative dehydrogenation process; with the consumption of surface lattice oxygen and the oxygen migration from the bulk to the surface, the oxidative and nonoxidative dehydrogenations occur simultaneously until the regeneration. The present study broadens the understanding of ethane CL-ODH over metal oxide catalysts and provides valuable information for the optimization of the CL-ODH process and the development of other high-performance metal oxide catalysts in other alkane CL-ODH processes.

1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Shale gas with high ethane contents (up to 20 vol %) is widely studied to produce ethylene due to its abundant reserves; (1−3) nowadays, two processes exist for alkane dehydrogenation to olefins: direct dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation. Despite ethane direct dehydrogenation (EDH) showing high ethylene selectivity, it is a strongly endothermic process and easily deactivated by coking. (4−7) On the contrary, due to oxygen participation, ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is thermodynamically favorable (ΔH298K = −105.4 kJ·mol–1) (8,9) and anticoking. (5−7,10,11) Metal oxides, such as VOx, (12−15) CoOx, (16,17) CrOx, (18) NiOx, (19,20) and MoOx, (8) have been shown to effectively promote ODH of ethane and propane; among them, VOx-based catalysts exhibit the best performance.
In the alkane dehydrogenation process, the initial C–H bond cleavage is extensively considered to be the rate-determining step. (21) Thus, once the C–H bond of alkane is activated, its oxygenated products are hard to be suppressed since the overoxidation to CO or CO2 is thermodynamically more favorable. (22,23) Furthermore, the selectivity of olefin formation decreases with increasing temperature during the oxidative dehydrogenation process of alkane, for example, ethylene selectivity in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation over the VOx/c-Al2O3 catalyst gradually decreased from 550 to 700 °C. (24) Propylene selectivity decreased with increasing temperature for propane chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation over Ga-based, Mo-based, and V-based catalysts. (25) Thus, if ethane can be activated at a relatively low temperature, it is expected to inhibit deep oxidation of ethylene, thereby improving the selectivity of C2H4(g) formation. In recent years, the IrO2 catalyst has been widely studied since it can easily activate alkanes at low temperature below 300 K, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the stoichiometric IrO2(110) surface has strong adsorption and activation ability toward methane and ethane; (26,27) then, the experiment reported that methane and ethane are easily activated over IrO2(110) at 150 K. (22,28) More importantly, the partially reduced IrO2 surface presents a higher CH4 activity compared to that of the stoichiometric IrO2 surface, demonstrating the influence of the IrO2 surface state on the activity, (29) namely, enhancing the partial oxidation selectivity over IrO2(110) by modulating the surface O state may provide an opportunity to develop low-temperature ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene.
The conventional ODH method over metal oxides confronts some practical challenges, for example, the cofeeding of mixed ethane and gaseous oxygen leads to a potential safety hazard, and air separation units upstream of the ODH reactor are costly and energy-intensive to build and operate; furthermore, oxygen adsorption generates electrophilic oxygen species (O– and O2–), which will overoxidize ethylene, resulting in a decrease of ODH selectivity. (30) To overcome these challenges, the chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) method over metal oxides was proposed. In the process of CL-ODH, (13,31−33) with the assistance of oxygen carriers, CL-ODH decomposes one chemical reaction into two subreactions, and alkane is first oxidized by the surface lattice oxygen of oxygen carriers to produce ethylene and water in the dehydrogenation process instead of the pure oxygen; as the dehydrogenation process proceeds, the bulk lattice oxygen of oxygen carriers migrates toward the surface to replenish the surface lattice oxygen atoms, resulting in the production of reduced oxygen carriers; then, the reduced oxygen carriers are fully regenerated by air or pure oxygen to replenish the lattice oxygen, finally returning to the dehydrogenation process to complete the redox cycle. (32,34) Thus, the CL-ODH method solves the drawbacks of overoxidation of ethylene caused by the cofeeding of mixed ethane and gaseous oxygen in the conventional ODH, leading to the low carbon emission, sustainable, and renewable properties. (25,35,36)
For ethane CL-ODH, the VOx-based catalysts showed excellent ethylene selectivity (84.5%), but the ethylene yield was generally lower than 15% owing to the low ethane conversion (6.5%) at 550–600 °C. (30,37) The ethylene yield over Fe-based perovskites was significantly increased to 55% at 700 °C, but the oxygen capacity was lower than 0.7 wt %. (36,38) Li et al. (39) reported the sub-monolayer MoO3/Al2O3 catalyst with excellent ethylene selectivity, but the lower oxidation state triggered the generation of H2 and CH4, resulting in a large selectivity loss, which sharply decreased from 96 to 82% at 500–600 °C. Yusuf et al. (40) studied ethane CL-ODH over mixed iron manganese redox catalysts, and the 20:80 (Fe–Mn molar ratios) redox catalyst exhibited 62.21% ethylene yield and 3.15% COx selectivity after being promoted with Na2WO4 at 900 °C. Thus, ethane conversion to ethylene with high selectivity can be achieved by CL-ODH at higher temperature, but the yield of ethylene remains to be further improved. Correspondingly, the redox catalysts that are active for ethane CL-ODH at significantly lower temperatures are highly desirable from a practical standpoint.
As mentioned above, the potential redox catalysts of ethane CL-ODH should focus on lower C–H bond activation barriers to obtain higher C2H4(g) formation activity at lower temperature, facilitate C2H4* desorption to obtain higher C2H4(g) selectivity, and inhibit the formation of the coke precursor to enhance catalyst stability. Moreover, the redox catalyst should also have high oxygen storage capacity and fast oxygen donation rate to ensure the oxygen carrier lifetime. Furthermore, in the process of catalyst regeneration, the reduced catalyst should favor oxygen adsorption and dissociation, leading to the easy regeneration of the reduced catalyst. As a result, the combination of the CL-ODH method with the IrO2 catalyst that can efficiently activate the C–H bond at lower temperature may be expected to obtain higher energy efficiency and better C2H4(g) selectivity and activity in ethane dehydrogenation. However, during the ethane CL-ODH process, due to the absence of O2 cofeeding, the lattice oxygen will be gradually consumed. When the migration rate of lattice oxygen from the bulk to the surface is lower than the consumption rate of surface lattice oxygen, the stoichiometric IrO2 surface will be reduced to form the reduced IrO2 surface. More importantly, the reduced surface of metal oxides played a decisive role in regulating the catalytic performance. (13,41) Thus, for ethane CL-ODH over the IrO2 catalyst, it is necessary to unravel the evolution of the surface state of the IrO2 catalyst and identify catalytic performance difference between the stoichiometric and reduced IrO2 surfaces and further reveal the evolution of the catalytic performance during the ethane CL-ODH process. More specifically, the crucial steps in the CL-ODH process, including the formation mechanism of oxygen vacancies and oxygen migration from the bulk to the surface over the IrO2 catalyst, the regeneration mechanism of the reduced IrO2 surface through O2 oxidation, and catalyst deactivation mechanism, and the influence of the above-mentioned crucial steps on the catalytic performance also need to be further clarified.
This work aims at combining the advantages of IrO2 and the CL-ODH process to unravel the evolution of the catalyst surface state and the influences of the above-mentioned crucial steps on the catalytic performance of ethane dehydrogenation. The full reaction network of ethane dehydrogenation over the stoichiometric IrO2 (S-IrO2) and reduced IrO2 (R-IrO2) catalysts including C–C cracking, dehydrogenation, coke formation, and their oxidation reactions and thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are all examined. Meanwhile, after the formation of surface oxygen vacancy sites (Ov) over the IrO2 catalyst, the migration mechanism of bulk lattice oxygen atoms toward the surface Ov site is further explored by DFT calculations. Then, DFT results are fed into kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations to clarify the formation mechanism of S-IrO2 surface oxygen vacancies, migration mechanism of bulk lattice oxygen, and deactivation and regeneration mechanism of the R-IrO2 surface, which are expected to predict the reaction rate and C2H4(g) selectivity under the realistic experimental conditions. Finally, the surface state evolution process of the IrO2 catalyst and the change trend and approximate range of catalytic performance over the IrO2 catalyst in ethane CL-ODH could be clearly clarified. These results are desired to provide valuable information for the optimization of the CL-ODH process and the development of other high-performance metal oxide catalysts in other alkane CL-ODH processes.

2.1. Computational Methods
DFT calculations were performed in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). (42,43) The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional was employed based on generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The plane-wave basis set was truncated with a kinetic energy of 400 eV. (44) Grimme’s DFT-D3 method was employed to consider dispersion interactions. (45) The Monkhorst–Pack mesh k-point (46) of 7 × 7 × 10 for the bulk IrO2 was used, and a 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point was applied for the stoichiometric and reduced IrO2(110) surfaces. The smearing width was set to 0.05 eV. The maximum force tolerance was 0.05 eV·Å–1 for the convergence criterion of structure optimization and transition state search. The transition states were roughly identified with the climbing-image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) (47−50) and further refined with a dimer method. (51,52) All transition states were again identified with only one imaginary frequency.
2.2. Surface Models
The calculated lattice parameters (a = b = 4.53 Å and c = 3.18 Å) of bulk IrO2 are consistent with the experimental values, (53) as presented in Table S1. The (110) surface of IrO2 is the most stable and mainly exposed surface, (54) and the surface contains fivefold coordinated Ir atoms (Ir5CN), twofold coordinated O atoms (O2CN), and threefold coordinated O atoms (O3CN). Among them, Ir5CN and O2CN are considered active sites of ethane adsorption and activation. For the stoichiometric IrO2(110) surface, four layers with a 12 Å-thick slab are employed. The bottom two layers are fixed, and top two layers are relaxed. In the alkane CL-ODH process, without O2 replenishment lattice oxygen in time, the surface structure of the redox oxide catalyst always undergoes dynamic changes over time along the consumption of surface lattice oxygen and the bulk lattice oxygen migration toward the surface. (55,56) When surface lattice oxygen atoms are removed from the S-IrO2 surface in the form of H2O(g), CO(g), and CO2(g), surface oxygen vacancies are generated, followed by the lattice oxygen migration from the bulk to the surface. Meanwhile, when the migration rate of the lattice oxygen from the bulk to the surface is lower than the consumption rate of surface lattice oxygen, the stoichiometric S-IrO2 surface will be preferentially reduced and gradually converted to the reduced R-IrO2 surface. More importantly, since the surface structure of the IrO2 catalyst always undergoes dynamic changes along the process of ethane CL-ODH, the specific surface structure of the IrO2 catalyst remains unclear. Huš et al. (41) also constructed the stoichiometric and reduced surfaces as two extreme states to simulate the Cr2O3 surface with different oxidation states in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. Similarly, in this study, by removing all surface two-coordinated O atoms (O2CN) from the stoichiometric IrO2(110), the reduced IrO2(110) surface is constructed as an extreme reduced state in the ethane CL-ODH process. Furthermore, based on the catalytic performance of the stoichiometric and reduced IrO2(110), the surface state evolution process of IrO2 and the change trend and possible range of the catalytic performance in ethane CL-ODH under the realistic reaction conditions could be revealed.
The stoichiometric IrO2(110) surface is denoted as S-IrO2, and the reduced IrO2(110) surface is represented as R-IrO2. The R-IrO2(110) surface contains fourfold coordinated Ir atoms (Ir4CN), fivefold coordinated Ir atoms (Ir5CN), and threefold coordinated O atoms (O3CN). For S-IrO2 and R-IrO2, a p(2 × 4) unit cell corresponds to a 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point. An additional 25 Å vacuum is set to avoid spurious interactions between the slabs. The top and side views of S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 catalysts are presented in Figure 1a–d.

The blue, red, and green balls denote Ir atoms, threefold coordinated O atoms (O3CN), and surface twofold coordinated O atoms (O2CN), respectively. The lattice (40 × 40) employed in kMC simulations, Ir5CN sites (purple squares) and O2CN sites (green circles) are considered over the S-IrO2(110) surface (e), and Ir5CN sites (purple squares) and Ir4CN–Ir4CN bridge (B-Ir4CN) sites (blue circles) are considered over the R-IrO2(110) surface (f).
2.3. Kinetic Parameters
After calculating the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of all elementary reactions via DFT calculations, the dynamics of ethane dehydrogenation considering the interactions between adsorbates are characterized via kMC simulations of the Zacros software package. (57,58) Previous studies have described the method. (10,59) Detailed calculations of the reaction rate and partition function are presented in Section 5 of the Supporting Information.
2.4. kMC Simulations
kMC simulations were performed within Zacros (version 2.0) based on the graph theoretical framework of Stamatakis and co-workers. (57,58,60−62) As illustrated in Figure 1e, for the S-IrO2 surface, the calculations were run on a tetragonal-like lattice with two types of sites, “O2CN” and “Ir5CN”, correspondingly, O2CN atoms (for binding the hydrogen atom) and Ir5CN atoms (for binding the hydrocarbons), totaling 6400 sites (4 × 40 × 40), including 3200 “O2CN” sites and 3200 “Ir5CN” sites. For the R-IrO2 surface, as shown in Figure 1f, “B-Ir4CN” represents the bridge site (falling position of the H atom) of four-coordination Ir atoms (Ir4CN), and “Ir5CN” represents five-coordination Ir atoms. It also includes 6400 sites (3200 “B-Ir4CN” sites and 3200 “Ir5CN” sites).
To reduce the computational time, the adsorption considers their forward and reverse constants scaled down to fit the slow reaction steps until their relative frequency could be compared, which would not affect the reaction equilibrium state. (63) The partially hydrogenated IrO2(110) surface exhibited higher ethylene production since it suppressed the oxidation to COx species. (28) The VOx-based catalyst covered with OH groups possesses a lower PDH activity than that of the catalyst without OH groups, since the surface OH group could regulate the valence state of the exposed V atoms. (64) Namely, the hydrogen precoverage can improve olefin selectivity, but it also leads to a decrease of olefin activity. More importantly, although the hydroxyl group could improve olefin selectivity, H2 prereduction was not included in the CL-ODH process, which only included dehydrogenation and regeneration processes. (30−32) Thus, kMC simulations were set up with no prebound adsorbates on the lattice, and the effect of the OH group on the ethane CL-ODH process is not specifically discussed in this study. For the simulation of ethane dehydrogenation and regeneration processes, it ran for 3000 and 2 s (simulation time), respectively. All kMC simulation details are presented in the Supporting Information.

In the dehydrogenation process, C2H6(g) adsorbed over the catalyst surface to form C2H6*, followed by the dehydrogenation to C2H5* or C–C bond cracking to CH3* + CH3*. Then, C2H5* is involved in the dehydrogenation to C2H4*/CHCH3* and C–C bond cracking to CH2* + CH3*. Furthermore, C2H4* participates in the desorption to C2H4(g), dehydrogenation to CHCH2*, and C–C bond cracking to CH2* + CH2*. The process from C2H6* to C2H4(g) is desired, so C2H4* dehydrogenation to CHCH2*, CHCH3* formation, and all C–C bond breaking should be suppressed.
C2Hx* (x = 0–6) species undergo deep dehydrogenation or C–C cracking to generate byproducts CHCH(g), CH4(g), or C*, that is, coke precursors. For ethane dehydrogenation using temperature-programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS) over the IrO2 catalyst without O2 participation, 40% of the dissociated ethane could dehydrogenate and desorb as ethylene; the remainder is oxidized to COx species with the increase of temperature. (28) Thus, the path of C* reacting with lattice O to generate CO(g) and CO2(g) is considered, which could not only reduce C* deposition but also decrease C2H4(g) selectivity.
In alkane direct dehydrogenation, the catalysts are easily deactivated, caused by coking, (4−7) for example, the disordered aliphatic-type coke leads to the catalyst deactivation in propane direct dehydrogenation over Pt-based catalysts. (4) Similarly, over VOx-based catalysts, the coke is a mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and graphite carbon, causing catalyst deactivation. (65) Namely, in alkane direct dehydrogenation, there is the problem of coking deactivation, and the coke contains a certain amount of H. However, for ethane CL-ODH, no obvious coking or tar formation was observed in the pulse and continuous flow experiments, (31,34,66) for example, the NaW-LaMnO3 catalyst exhibited less than 1% of coke formation in ethane CL-ODH; (67) furthermore, coke formation can be eliminated by controlling the reduction and oxidation degree during methane chemical looping reforming. (68) More importantly, when pure CH4 was exposed over the IrO2(110) catalyst, surface carbon was undetectable in C 1s X-ray photoelectron spectra, indicating that carbon-containing intermediates are converted to CO and CO2 that promptly desorb at 500 and 600 K, respectively. (69) Thus, as presented in Figure 2, in the CL-ODH process, by controlling the time of dehydrogenation and regeneration processes, coke formation can be suppressed and made negligible; correspondingly, the reaction path of coke formation can be simplified.
In the regeneration process, O2(g) is adsorbed and activated over the R-IrO2 surface; then, the R-IrO2 surface is reconstructed to form the S-IrO2 surface. Dehydrogenation and regeneration processes occur alternately in the CL-ODH process, and ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to ethylene can be carried out to present high C2H4(g) selectivity.
3.2. Reaction Mechanism of Ethane CL-ODH
The TPRS experiment of ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene over IrO2(110) showed that ethylene desorption started at 350 K. (28) Moreover, when the temperature is 700 K, the reduction process is reversible, but above 800 K, the reduction process will be permanent and cannot be reoxidized. (70) Thus, the temperatures of 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, and 750 K are considered over the IrO2 catalyst for the ethane CL-ODH process. All energy data of elementary reactions involved in the process of ethane dehydrogenation are initially corrected at 750 K (Table 1). Correspondingly, free energy profiles are presented in Figures 3 and S2, and the structures of initial, transition, and final states over S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 catalysts are presented in Figures S1 and S2.

Figure 3. Free energy profiles of ethane dehydrogenation over the S-IrO2 catalyst at 750 K. The corresponding structures of initial, transition, and final states are presented in Figure S1. * and (g) represent the adsorbed and gaseous states, respectively.
3.2.1. Dehydrogenation of Ethane over the S-IrO2 Catalyst
For the dehydrogenation process over the S-IrO2 catalyst (Table 1 and Figure 3), although ethane binds to the surface with weak physisorption, the reaction proceeded rapidly. The activation free energies of C2H6* → C2H5* + H* and C2H6* → CH3* + CH3* are 53.6 and 209.4 kJ·mol–1, respectively, so the dehydrogenation to C2H5* is more favorable in kinetics. For C2H5* dehydrogenation to C2H4*/CHCH3* and C–C bond cracking to CH2* + CH3*, C2H4* formation is favored in thermodynamics (−21.5 vs −6.4 and 94.4 kJ·mol–1), while CHCH3* formation is favored in kinetics (115.4 vs 109.2 and 194.6 kJ·mol–1). C2H4* desorption is an exothermic (−0.7 kJ·mol–1) and spontaneous process, which is more favorable than C2H4* dehydrogenation to CHCH2* and C–C bond cracking to CH2* + CH2* (65.6 and 312.6 kJ·mol–1) in kinetics. Thus, at 750 K, C2H4* desorption over the S-IrO2 catalyst hardly affects C2H4(g) selectivity; C2H5* dehydrogenation to CHCH3* is the main step affecting C2H4(g) selectivity. Furthermore, Bian et al. (28) predicted that the barrier of C2H6* dehydrogenation is 38 kJ·mol–1 and it is exothermic by about 97 kJ·mol–1, which is close to our results.
As presented in Table 1 and Figure 3, starting with the CHCH3* intermediate, the dehydrogenation to CHCH2* is more superior to the dehydrogenation to CCH3* and C–C bond cracking to CH* + CH3* in kinetics (68.6 vs 104.3 and 213.2 kJ·mol–1). Similarly, CHCH2* dehydrogenation to CHCH* is also more favorable than the dehydrogenation to CCH2* and C–C bond cracking to CH* + CH2*. Like C2H4*, CHCH* desorption is favored kinetically than its dehydrogenation to CCH* and C–C bond cracking to CH* + CH* (56.9 vs 105.5 and 443.5 kJ·mol–1). Thus, the byproduct CHCH(g) formation primarily goes through the path of C2H6* → C2H5* → CHCH3* → CHCH2* → CHCH* → CHCH(g). Combined with the above-mentioned analysis, in the process of C2H6* dehydrogenation to C2H4(g), CHCH(g) is the main side product; meanwhile, a small amount of C2Hx* (x = 0–6) may undergo the C–C bond cracking to generate CHx* (x = 0–3) and then be oxidized to CO(g) and CO2(g) or hydrogenated to CH4(g) over the S-IrO2 catalyst.
According to TPRS results for C2H6 dehydrogenation over the IrO2 catalyst, (28) the products are C2H4(g), a small amount of C2H2(g) and CH4(g), and a large amount of CO(g) and CO2(g), suggesting that the C–C cracking of C2Hx* (x = 0–6) species will occur. In Table 1, the activation free energy (kJ·mol–1) of C–C bond cracking is in the order of CHCH2* (151.9) < CH2CH3* (194.6) < CH3CH3* (209.4) < CHCH3* (213.2) < CCH3* (219.7) < CC* (242.0) < CCH2* (268.3) < CCH* (305.4) < CH2CH2* (312.6) < CHCH* (443.5), in which CH3CH3* → CH3* + CH3* is exothermic by 100.4 kJ·mol–1 and the C–C bond cracking reactions of other C2Hx* (x = 0–6) species are endothermic. Thus, over the S-IrO2 catalyst, the CHCH2*, CH2CH3*, CH3CH3*, and CHCH3* intermediates are the possible precursors to generate CHx* (x = 0–3), so CH3* dehydrogenation to the coke precursor C* and hydrogenation to CH4* are studied.
As presented in Figure 3, since CH3* formed by the C–C bond cracking of CH2CH3* is the most favored in kinetics, starting from CH3*, the overall barrier of its continuous dehydrogenation to C*, followed by C* reacting with O2CN to form CO(g) or CO2(g), is 123.8 kJ·mol–1; it is strongly exothermic by 121.3 or 158.6 kJ·mol–1; meanwhile, oxygen vacancies (Ov) are formed. The barrier of CH3* hydrogenation to CH4(g) is 142.1 kJ·mol–1, while it is endothermic by 10.0 kJ·mol–1. Thus, for CHx* (x = 0–3) species, both CO(g) and CO2(g) formations are more favorable than that of CH4(g) in kinetics and thermodynamics.
3.2.2. Reduction of S-IrO2 to R-IrO2 Catalysts
As mentioned above, over the S-IrO2 catalyst, during CO(g) and CO2(g) formation, the O2CN atoms are consumed. Alternatively, H atoms from C2Hx* (x = 1–6) dehydrogenation react with O2CN atoms to form H2O(g), leading to Ov generation and the reduction of S-IrO2 to R-IrO2 catalysts. As the dehydrogenation process proceeds, the bulk lattice oxygen of oxygen carriers migrates toward the surface to replenish surface lattice oxygen atoms, resulting in further reduction of the S-IrO2 catalyst.
Since ethane dehydrogenation provides a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, the formation mechanism of the reduced R-IrO2 by H2O(g) generation is identified. For the adsorption of H from C2Hx* (x = 1–6) dehydrogenation over S-IrO2, the most stable site is the top O2CN site with the adsorption energy of −283.8 kJ·mol–1 at 0 K, while the adsorption energy at the top O3CN site is only −156.9 kJ·mol–1 at 0 K. Thus, as presented in Figure 4a and Table 1, the path via the transition state TS32 is two H atoms adsorbed at two adjacent O2CN atoms reacting with one O2CN to generate H2O(g). Correspondingly, the activation free energy of H2O(g) formation is 205.1 kJ·mol–1 and it is endothermic by 139.4 kJ·mol–1. Once H2O(g) is formed, the surface O2CN atom is taken away, leading to the reduction of S-IrO2. Moreover, as presented in Table 1 and Figure 3, CO2(g) and CO(g) generation is more favorable in kinetics (80.5 and 80.5 vs 205.1 kJ·mol–1) and thermodynamics (−180.8 and −143.5 vs 139.4 kJ·mol–1) than H2O(g) formation. However, considering the high coverage of surface H species in ethane dehydrogenation, H2O(g) generation may dominantly contribute to Ov generation over the S-IrO2 catalyst. Thus, generation of H2O(g), CO(g), and CO2(g) leads to the reduction of the S-IrO2 surface.
Figure 4

Free energy profiles of (a) H2O(g) formation over the S-IrO2 catalyst, (b) lattice oxygen migration from the subsurface to the surface over the S-IrO2 catalyst, and (c) R-IrO2 surface regeneration process at 750 K with the structures of initial, transition, and final states. IrO2(110) surfaces with one, two, and three oxygen vacancy sites (Ov) are considered. The yellow ball denotes the subsurface O atoms (Osub) exposed in the presence of surface oxygen vacancies (Ov-sur); the green, red, and dark-blue balls and black square frame denote the surface O2CN, O3CN, and Ir atoms and subsurface oxygen vacancy sites (Ov-sub), respectively.
For the lattice oxygen migration from the subsurface to the surface over the IrO2 catalyst, the IrO2(110) surfaces with one, two, and three oxygen vacancy sites (Ov) were considered; as presented in Figure 4b and Table 1, the activation free energies of oxygen migration from the subsurface to the surface are 205.2, 123.1, and 69.0 kJ·mol–1 at 750 K, which correspond to IrO2(110) surfaces with one, two, and three Ov sites, respectively. Thus, the higher concentration of surface Ov sites means easier oxygen migration from the subsurface to the surface, that is, as the ethane dehydrogenation reaction proceeds through the interaction with the surface lattice oxygen, increasing the surface Ov sites facilitates the lattice oxygen migration from the subsurface to the surface; as a result, IrO2 can supply lattice oxygen to the surface to participate in ethane CL-ODH. Generally, the combination of H2O(g), CO(g), and CO2(g) generation and the migration of the bulk lattice oxygen to the surface lattice jointly leads to the reduction of the S-IrO2 catalyst. Furthermore, the evolution of the IrO2 surface structure considering the above-mentioned reactions was investigated in kMC simulations.
3.2.3. Dehydrogenation of Ethane over the R-IrO2 Catalyst
For the dehydrogenation process over R-IrO2 at 750 K (Table 1 and Figure S2), C2H6* → C2H5* + H* is kinetically favorable than C2H6* → CH3* + CH3* (67.1 vs 204.6 kJ·mol–1). Subsequently, C2H5* → CHCH3* + H* is kinetically favored compared to C2H5* → C2H4* + H* and C2H5* → CH2* + CH3* (67.9 vs 118.4 and 149.6 kJ·mol–1). As for the C2H4* species, its desorption to C2H4(g) is kinetically superior to the dehydrogenation to CHCH2* and the C–C bond cracking to CH2* + CH2* (62.5 vs 77.1 and 210.8 kJ·mol–1) over R-IrO2. Furthermore, CHCH3* dehydrogenation to CHCH2* is superior to the dehydrogenation to CCH3* and the C–C bond cracking to CH* + CH3* in kinetics (48.2 vs 128.1 and 218.0 kJ·mol–1). Like the CHCH3* species, CHCH2* dehydrogenation to CHCH* is superior to its dehydrogenation to CCH2* and C–C bond cracking to CH* + CH2* in kinetics (51.1 vs 111.2 and 268.9 kJ·mol–1). Thus, over R-IrO2 (Figure S2), CHCH(g) formation primarily goes through the path of C2H6* → C2H5* → CHCH3* → CHCH2* → CHCH* → CHCH(g), which agrees with that over S-IrO2. Furthermore, the C–C bond cracking of all C2Hx* (x = 0–6) species was examined.
As listed in Table 1, the activation free energy (kJ·mol–1) of C–C bond cracking is in the order of CH2CH3* (149.6) < CCH3* (166.5) < CC* (181.3) < CH3CH3* (204.6) < CH2CH2* (210.8) < CHCH3* (218.0) < CCH2* (219.4) < CHCH2* (268.9) < CCH* (371.4) < CHCH* (432.0). CH3CH3* → CH3* + CH3* and CCH3* → C* + CH3* are exothermic by 132.3 and 5.7 kJ·mol–1, respectively. All other C–C bond cracking reactions are endothermic. Thus, considering the kinetics and thermodynamics, the CH2CH3*, CCH3*, and CH3CH3* intermediates are the most possible precursors to generate CHx* (x = 0–3); then, CH3* dehydrogenation to form the coke precursor C* and its hydrogenation to CH4* over the R-IrO2 catalyst were further investigated.
As presented in Figure S2, since CH3* formed by the C–C bond cracking of CH2CH3* is the most favored in kinetics, starting from CH3*, the overall barrier of its continuous dehydrogenation to C* is 143.6 kJ·mol–1, and it is exothermic by 6.9 kJ·mol–1. However, the activation free energy of CH3* hydrogenation to CH4(g) is 224.6 kJ·mol–1, and it is endothermic by 77.5 kJ·mol–1. Thus, the formation of C* is favorable both in kinetics and thermodynamics than CH4(g) generation, and the accumulation of the C* species over the R-IrO2 catalyst may occur during the long-term operation.
Propane CL-ODH over Mo–V–O mixed oxides showed that different reaction regions were observed with the depletion of lattice oxygen: an initial region affected by CO2 was generated due to the overoxidation, the oxidative dehydrogenation region is dominated by C3H6 and H2O, and the nonoxidative dehydrogenation region with V3+ and V–O–Mo species served as active sites. (13) Over the R-IrO2(110) catalyst, the adsorption energy of H adsorbed at the Ir4CN–Ir4CN bridge site is −337.4 kJ·mol–1 and that of H adsorbed at the O3CN site is −219.2 kJ·mol–1. Thus, the most stable adsorption site of H is the Ir4CN–Ir4CN bridge site over the R-IrO2(110) surface, and H atoms adsorbed at two adjacent Ir4CN–Ir4CN bridge sites easily recombine into H2 and then desorb. Usually, H is strongly adsorbed at the O site over the metal oxide surface, (17) which agrees with our results, that is, H strongly adsorbed at the O2CN site over the S-IrO2 surface. Thus, the analysis of electronic properties was carried out to further investigate why H prefers to adsorb at the Ir4CN–Ir4CN bridge site over the R-IrO2(110) surface. As presented in Figure S8, the charge density difference shows that H adsorbed at the O3CN site loses electrons, while H adsorbed at the Ir4CN–Ir4CN bridge site gains electrons. Moreover, partial density of states (pDOS) shows that the coordination-unsaturated Ir4CN gives a higher local 4f electron energy level than that of O3CN over the R-IrO2 surface and tends to provide the electrons for the adsorbed H to produce the most stable H species.
3.2.4. Comparison of the Catalytic Performances between S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 Catalysts
To quantify the C2H4(g) formation activity, the rate-determining step from C2H6* to C2H4(g) is identified. As presented in Table 1 and Figure 3, over S-IrO2, the activation free energies of the first and second dehydrogenations of ethane are 53.6 and 115.4 kJ·mol–1, respectively, and C2H4* desorption to C2H4(g) is an exothermic process (−0.7 kJ·mol–1), that is, the rate-determining step is C2H5* → C2H4* + H*. Over R-IrO2 (Table 1 and Figure S2), those of the first and second dehydrogenations of ethane are 67.1 and 118.4 kJ·mol–1, respectively, and C2H4* desorption to C2H4(g) is endothermic by 62.5 kJ·mol–1, that is, C2H5* → C2H4* + H* is the rate-determining step. Thus, the C2H4(g) formation activity over S-IrO2 is slightly better than that over R-IrO2 (115.4 vs 118.4 kJ·mol–1).
Based on the above-mentioned analysis, two processes to affect C2H4(g) selectivity are C2H4* desorption and C2H5* dehydrogenation, which could reduce C2H4(g) selectivity. (71,72) Therefore, the energy difference of C2H4* dehydrogenation minus C2H4* desorption (ΔG1) and that of C2H5* dehydrogenation to CHCH3* minus its dehydrogenation to C2H4* (ΔG2) are employed to quantitatively describe the C2H4(g) selectivity; the more positive and larger values of ΔG1 and ΔG2 mean better C2H4(g) selectivity. As shown in Figure 5, C2H4(g) selectivity over the S-IrO2 catalyst is better than that over the R-IrO2 catalyst irrespective of ΔG1 (66.3 vs 14.6 kJ·mol–1) or ΔG2 (−6.2 vs −50.5 kJ·mol–1) as the criterion. Thus, for ethane CL-ODH, the S-IrO2 catalyst exhibits a higher C2H4(g) activity and selectivity than those of the R-IrO2 catalyst.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Activation free energy difference between C2H4(g)/C2H3* and C2H4*/CHCH3* formation at 750 K over S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 catalysts.
Due to the occurrence of C–C bond cracking, the dissociation and hydrogenation processes of CH3* were further investigated. CH3* hydrogenation to CH4(g) is unfavorable over S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 catalysts; CH3* tends to continuously dehydrogenate to form C* and then reacts with lattice oxygen (O2CN) to produce CO2(g) over S-IrO2. However, over R-IrO2, CH3* will continuously dehydrogenate to C*, which may lead to the catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition. Thus, it is necessary to carry out the regeneration process of the IrO2 catalyst in ethane CL-ODH.
3.2.5. Regeneration of the R-IrO2 Catalyst
As shown in Figure 4c, O2(g) adsorbs at the four-coordinated Ir atoms (Ir4CN) over the R-IrO2 surface with an adsorption free energy of −127.8 kJ·mol–1. Then, O2* is easily dissociated into two adsorbed O atoms at the bridge sites of four-coordinated Ir (Ir4CN–Ir4CN), which has a small activation free energy of 43.9 kJ·mol–1, and it is strongly exothermic by 350.2 kJ·mol–1.
As presented in Figure 1a–d, the adsorption site of the oxygen atom from O2(g) dissociation over the R-IrO2 surface is the position of O2CN over the S-IrO2 surface. Furthermore, a large amount of O2(g) dissociation oxidizes the R-IrO2 surface to the S-IrO2 surface, thus realizing the regeneration of R-IrO2 into the S-IrO2 surface. Meanwhile, O2(g) oxidation not only regenerates surface oxygen vacancies but also burns off CHx* (x = 1–3) and C* species that occupy Ir5CN sites to produce CO(g) and CO2(g). The mechanism of oxygen replenishment over the reduced perovskites in chemical looping redox reactions showed that O2(g) preferentially adsorbs at the vacancy position of the reduced surface with a vacancy coverage of above 1/4 ML, and then, the adjacent oxygen vacancies heal. (73) It is like the O2(g) replenishment mechanism discussed above; O2(g) is adsorbed on the R-IrO2 surface and then dissociated and filled into two adjacent oxygen vacancies. Thus, the existence of O2CN atoms over the S-IrO2 surface promotes ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene, while the R-IrO2 surface can be easily oxidized by O2(g) and then regenerated into the S-IrO2 surface, which realizes an ethane CL-ODH cycle over the IrO2 catalyst.
4. General Discussion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Despite the detailed discussion of the reaction process by DFT calculations, it is still incomplete to clarify the reaction pathway and elementary reactions occurring over the catalyst surface, such as the influences of the lateral interactions between adsorbed sites, and the intermediate coverage and the numbers of active sites are not considered. (58,74,75) Furthermore, the catalytic performance under the specific experimental conditions is also difficult to be described by DFT calculations, such as the reaction temperature and pressure of reactants (C2H6(g) in the dehydrogenation process and O2(g) in the regeneration process). (76,77) Thus, kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations were established, which are expected to simulate the specific turnover frequency (TOF) and selectivity of each product in ethane CL-ODH under the realistic reaction conditions. More importantly, both the below-mentioned discussions and the obtained results are only based on the results of kMC simulations.
On the other hand, in the CL-ODH process, the surface structure of the redox oxide catalyst always undergoes dynamic changes with the consumption of surface lattice oxygen and the bulk lattice oxygen migration toward the surface. (55,56) However, kMC simulations are generally based on the definite catalyst surface structure. (58−62) Thus, the stoichiometric IrO2(110) and the reduced IrO2(110) with the removal of all surface O2CN atoms are constructed to present two extreme states of the IrO2 surface structure under the realistic reaction conditions. In the present study, taking the S-IrO2 catalyst as the initial state in the CL-ODH process, our results show that the formation of surface oxygen vacancies corresponds to Ov* species generation; meanwhile, the surface oxygen vacancy sites do not act as the active sites to participate in ethane dehydrogenation. Through the definition of Ov* species, the reduction process of S-IrO2 to R-IrO2 can be examined using kMC simulations, and the coverage of Ov* species over the IrO2 surface can be used to quantify the reduction degree of the IrO2 surface in the ethane dehydrogenation process. By simulating ethane dehydrogenation over S-IrO2, the TOF and selectivity of C2H4(g) formation over the IrO2 surface with the minimum reduction degree can be obtained. Meanwhile, R-IrO2 is employed to model the IrO2 surface structure with the maximum reduction degree, and the TOF and selectivity of C2H4(g) formation over the R-IrO2 catalyst surface can be obtained. Furthermore, based on the catalytic performance of stoichiometric IrO2(110) and reduced IrO2(110), the surface state evolution process of the IrO2 catalyst and the change trend and possible range of catalytic performance in ethane CL-ODH under the realistic reaction conditions could be revealed. Moreover, the conversion between S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 surfaces in the CL-ODH process can be realized by ethane dehydrogenation and the regeneration process of oxygen adsorption and dissociation.
In kMC simulations, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, and methane can achieve fast adsorption–desorption equilibrium, while other hydrocarbon radical species are adsorbed too strongly to move. Since the adsorption energies of H* atoms over S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 are −285.3 and −337.4 kJ·mol–1 at 0 K, respectively, the adsorption is also very strong, so the diffusion of H atoms is not considered. The cluster expansion Hamiltonian model is used to describe the interaction energies for the coadsorbed species. For the coadsorbed CxHy* (x = 1–2, y = 0–6) and H* or CxHy* species and coadsorbed H* and H*, the adsorption sites of the two coadsorbed species are connected, and the interactions of the first-nearest-neighbor (1NN pattern) two-body terms are considered. The interaction energies of all coadsorbed species over S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 catalysts are listed in Tables S7 and S10; correspondingly, the details about the relevant calculation methods are presented in Section 6.2 of the Supporting Information. According to the thermal stability of the IrO2 catalyst in Section 3.2, kMC simulations were carried out at 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, and 750 K to further study the influence of temperature on the catalytic performance of IrO2 for ethane dehydrogenation. Meanwhile, the C2H6(g) pressure was fixed at 0.8 bar according to the experimental conditions of ethane CL-ODH. (30,45) Based on the industrial propane dehydrogenation of 1 atm, the effect of pressure on the catalytic performance of the IrO2 catalyst was investigated by setting the temperature at 750 K and C2H6(g) pressure at 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 bar, respectively.
Under the premise of keeping C2H4(g) formation activity (TOF) and selectivity, the simulation time of 3000 s is determined, as presented in Figures S3 and S4. Moreover, Figure 6a–d shows C2H4(g) activity and selectivity over the oxidized catalyst (S-IrO2) and reduced catalyst (R-IrO2).
Figure 6
Figure 6. C2H4(g) formation activity and selectivity over (a) S-IrO2 and (b) R-IrO2 catalysts at 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, and 750 K, P(C2H6) = 0.8 bar, and (c) S-IrO2 and (d) R-IrO2 catalysts at 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 bar, T = 750 K. All kMC simulation times are 3000 s.
4.1. Influences of Temperature and C2H6(g) Pressure on the Dehydrogenation Process
Over the S-IrO2 catalyst (Figure 6a), C2H4(g) TOF values within 3000 s at 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, and 750 K are 2.08 × 10–7, 5.42 × 10–6, 3.58 × 10–5, 9.15 × 10–5, 1.14 × 10–4, 1.30 × 10–4, 1.55 × 10–4, 1.61 × 10–4, and 1.81 × 10–4 s–1·site–1, respectively. Correspondingly, C2H4(g) selectivity values are 0.15, 3.72, 20.13, 37.16, 42.10, 44.05, 46.23, 46.11, and 47.42%, respectively. C2H4(g) formation activity and selectivity continuously increase from 350 to 750 K, while the increase in the amplitude of C2H4(g) activity and selectivity decreases gradually with increasing temperature. Thus, within different temperature ranges, the influence of temperature on the catalytic performance is different. Below 500 K, the reaction temperature has a great influence on the C2H4(g) activity and selectivity, while when the reaction temperature is higher than 500 K, the temperature has a slight influence. Moreover, with increasing C2H6(g) pressure, after 3000 s simulation time, TOF and selectivity of C2H4(g) formation exhibit a slight change trend and fluctuate within a certain range (Figure 6c). Furthermore, C2H4(g) formation activity and selectivity under different C2H6(g) pressures during 1 × 108 simulation events (Figure S7a) showed that with increasing pressure, C2H4(g) formation activity increases, while C2H4(g) selectivity increases first and then decreases.
Over the R-IrO2 catalyst (Figure 6b), C2H4(g) TOF values within 3000 s at 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, and 750 K are 0.00, 0.00, 6.15 × 10–6, 2.80 × 10–5, 3.66 × 10–5, 5.66 × 10–5, 1.03 × 10–4, 4.14 × 10–4, and 3.96 × 10–3 s–1·site–1, respectively. Correspondingly, C2H4(g) selectivity values are 0.00, 0.00, 4.10, 16.14, 20.18, 28.30, 40.71, 67.83, and 84.02%. Obviously, C2H4(g) formation activity and selectivity increase with the increasing temperature. As for the influence of pressure, after 3000 s simulation time, TOF and selectivity of C2H4(g) formation fluctuate within a certain range, and no obvious change trends are found (Figure 6d). Furthermore, during 1 × 108 simulation events, C2H4(g) formation activity increases, while C2H4(g) selectivity increases first and then decreases.
As presented in Figure 6a,b, compared to the S-IrO2 catalyst, the R-IrO2 surface exhibits poor C2H4(g) TOF and selectivity at temperatures below or equal to 650 K, whereas higher C2H4(g) TOF and selectivity over R-IrO2 appear at a temperature of above 650 K. Thus, comprehensively considering C2H4(g) formation activity and selectivity over S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 catalysts at different temperatures, 750 K may be suitable for ethane CL-ODH over IrO2 catalysts. Moreover, compared to reaction temperature, C2H6(g) pressure has a slight influence on the catalytic performance of ethane dehydrogenation over S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 catalysts.
4.2. Formation of Surface Oxygen Vacancies
The formation of surface oxygen vacancies and oxygen migration from the bulk to the surface together lead to the reduction of the IrO2 catalyst, corresponding to different IrO2 surface states and different catalytic performances. Figure 7 presents the coverage of surface oxygen vacancies (Ov*), H*, CHx* (x = 0–4), and C2Hx* (x = 0–6) and C2H4(g) selectivity at 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, and 750 K within 3000 s simulation time. The maximum coverage fraction of Ov*, H*, and CHx* is 0.5 ML since both “O2CN” sites and “Ir5CN” sites account for half of the total sites, individually. Moreover, since each C2Hx* occupies two Ir5CN sites, its maximum coverage fraction is 0.25 ML.
Figure 7
Figure 7. C2H4(g) selectivity (left axis) and species coverage (right axis) over the S-IrO2 catalyst at T = 350 K (a), 400 K (b), 450 K (c), 500 K (d), 550 K (e), 600 K (f), 650 K (g), 700 K (h), and 750 K (i) with P(C2H6) = 0.8 bar and simulation time of 3000 s. The red, blue, black, and green solid lines represent the coverage of surface oxygen vacancies, C2Hx* (x = 0–6), CHx* (x = 0–4), and H* species, respectively.
The Ov* concentration increases first and then decreases with increasing temperature. The Ov* coverage fractions are 0.028, 0.043, 0.101, 0.111, 0.121, 0.129, 0.134, 0.136, and 0.124 ML at 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, and 750 K, respectively. From 700 to 750 K, the decrease in the Ov* coverage fraction may be attributed to the promotion of oxygen migration from the subsurface to the surface. The maximum concentration of Ov* is 0.136 ML, that is, after 3000 s simulation time, 27.2% (0.136/0.5) of O2CN atoms are reduced over S-IrO2. Thus, with the accumulation of Ov*, the S-IrO2 surface converts to the partially reduced surface; both S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 surfaces simultaneously exist after 3000 s simulation time. Along the time evolution of the Ov* concentration at different temperatures in Figure 7, the higher the temperature is, the earlier the Ov* begins to accumulate in large quantities. As presented in Figure 7i, the coverage fraction of H* species, namely, OH group, is 0.221 ML at 750 K; the coverage of OH groups almost did not change in the whole reaction process. In other words, under the realistic conditions, the coverage of OH groups over the IrO2 surface is low and has little change in the whole reaction process. Thus, the increase of C2H4(g) selectivity during ethane dehydrogenation is closely related to the surface oxygen vacancy (Ov) concentration instead of the OH group coverage. Overall, the adsorption of H* is temporary and does not hinder the reaction.
C2H4(g) formation activity and selectivity over the R-IrO2 catalyst are much better than those over the S-IrO2 catalyst at 750 K, as shown in Figure 6a,b. Thus, after 3000 s simulation time, the IrO2 surface becomes a partially reduced state, both S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 surfaces simultaneously exist, and the values of C2H4(g) TOF and selectivity over the IrO2 catalyst under the realistic conditions should also be in the middle between S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 catalysts.
4.3. Regeneration of the R-IrO2 Surface
According to the lattice snapshot after 2 s of the R-IrO2 surface at 750 K and 0.8 bar C2H6(g) pressure, as illustrated in Figure 8a,b, the slow conversion rates of CH2* and CH3* species induces the active sites to be occupied, leading to a decline of TOF and even catalyst deactivation. Thus, it is necessary to regenerate the catalyst by means of O2(g) oxidation. During the regeneration process, both CH2* and CH3* are removed; meanwhile, the IrO2 lattice will be reconstructed to form the S-IrO2 catalyst. Then, the catalyst participates in the next cycle of ethane CL-ODH.
Figure 8
Figure 8. (a) Lattice snapshot after 2 s of the R-IrO2 surface at T = 750 K and P(C2H6) = 0.8 bar. (b) Larger version of the box in (a). The oxidation degree of the R-IrO2 surface at (c) different temperatures under P(O2) = 0.17 bar and (d) different pressures at T = 750 K. All simulation times are 2 s. The oxidation degree is expressed as the ratio of the number of additional O2CN atoms of the R-IrO2 surface to the number of vacancy points (3200).
In the lattice (40 × 40) model, as shown in Figure 1e,f, the S-IrO2 surface has more than 3200 O2CN atoms compared to the R-IrO2 surface. Thus, in the regeneration process, the oxidation degree of the R-IrO2 surface is expressed by the ratio of the number of surface O atoms supplemented by O2(g) dissociation to the oxygen vacancy points (3200). The regeneration process of the R-IrO2 surface oxidized by O2(g) to the S-IrO2 surface was simulated in kMC simulations at 750 K, a simulation time of 2 s, and an O2(g) pressure of 0.17 bar, which is consistent with the experimental pressure. (34,40) As shown in Figure 8c, the regeneration process quickly reached equilibrium within 2 s, and the oxidation degree is 0.873. Furthermore, in the same simulation time, the effects of temperature and pressure on the oxidation degree of the R-IrO2 surface were investigated by fixing the temperature and pressure at 750 K and 0.17 bar, respectively. As presented in Figure 8c,d, both the temperature and pressure have little effect on the equilibrium of the oxidation process, and the surface oxidation degree fluctuates between 0.858 and 0.873. The minimum surface oxidation degree over the R-IrO2 surface is greater than the maximum Ov concentration over the S-IrO2 surface (0.858 vs 0.272), so the surface oxidative regeneration process of the IrO2 catalyst can be easily realized.
4.4. Summary of kMC Simulations under the Experimental Conditions
Over S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 catalysts, C2H4(g) TOF and selectivity increase as the temperature increases from 350 to 750 K, so the most suitable reaction temperature is 750 K. Comparing the C2H4(g) formation activity and selectivity over these two catalysts, when the temperature is below or equal to 650 K, the S-IrO2 catalyst is better than the R-IrO2 catalyst at the same temperature; however, at 700 and 750 K, the R-IrO2 catalyst is much better than the S-IrO2 catalyst. As presented in Figure S9, after removing all surface O2CN atoms from S-IrO2 to form R-IrO2, six-coordinated Ir6CN is converted to four-coordinated Ir4CN atoms, resulting in a significant charge increase from 7.290 to 7.886 e, while the charge of surface O3CN atoms bonded to Ir5CN atoms slightly increases from 6.825 to 6.834 e. Namely, compared to the S-IrO2 surface, the R-IrO2 surface charge is redistributed to enrich the electrons on the Ir4CN atoms, which changes the species adsorption site and ultimately leads to the difference of catalytic performance between S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 catalysts.
During the dehydrogenation process, the Ov concentration over the S-IrO2 surface first increases and then decreases with increasing temperature. From 700 (0.136) to 750 (0.124) K, the decrease in the Ov* coverage fraction may be attributed to the promotion of oxygen migration from the subsurface to the surface. After 3000 s simulation time, the Ov concentration is 0.124 at 750 K, so the IrO2 surface becomes a partially reduced state. Furthermore, in the regeneration process, the maximum oxidation degree of the R-IrO2 surface is 0.873 at 750 K and 0.17 bar O2(g) pressure. Thus, the S-IrO2 catalyst will not be completely reduced due to the continuous bulk lattice oxygen migration toward the surface; moreover, the R-IrO2 surface will not be completely oxidized by O2(g), that is, the surface state of the IrO2 catalyst under the realistic conditions should be the partially reduced surface between S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 surfaces. It can be inferred that under a H2 atmosphere, the complete reduction of the IrO2 catalyst surface also cannot be achieved due to the lattice oxygen migration from the bulk to the surface. Moreover, previously reported experiments (28,78) showed that the degree of reduction of the IrO2 catalyst varies greatly under the H2 atmospheres at different temperatures. For example, at 380 K, the hydrogen-precovered IrO2 catalyst with a large number of hydroxyl groups over the surface was prepared. (28) At 473 K, H2 pretreatment led to the formation of a mixed surface state of Ir and IrO2 from the stoichiometric IrO2; (78) furthermore, compared with IrO2, metal Ir is unfavorable for alkane activation. (69) To the best of our knowledge, there is no relevant experimental report on the preparation of the IrO2 catalyst with complete surface reduction so far. Overall, the R-IrO2 catalyst surface exhibiting excellent C2H4(g) formation activity and selectivity is just an instantaneous and extreme state in the reduction process, that is, H2 pretreatment cannot form the R-IrO2 surface with the removal of all surface O2CN atoms. Thus, using H2 prereduction to prepare the R-IrO2 catalyst and carry out nonoxidative dehydrogenation cannot be achieved.
Considering the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes over these two surfaces, 750 K is the optimal reaction temperature for ethane CL-ODH over the IrO2 catalyst. Under the optimal conditions of 750 K and 0.8 bar C2H6(g) pressure, C2H4(g) selectivity and TOF are 47.42% and 1.81 × 10–4 s–1·site–1 over the S-IrO2 catalyst and those over the R-IrO2 surface are 84.02% and 3.96 × 10–3 s–1·site–1, respectively. Thus, under the realistic reaction conditions, it is inferred that as the ethane dehydrogenation reaction proceeds through the interaction with surface lattice oxygen, increasing the surface Ov sites increases the reduction degree of the IrO2 surface and C2H4(g) formation activity and selectivity present an increasing trend. More importantly, the IrO2 catalyst surface can be neither completely reduced in the dehydrogenation process nor completely oxidized in the regeneration process, leading to the catalytic performance between S-IrO2 and R-IrO2. Based on these analyses, the surface state evolution process of the IrO2 catalyst, and the change trend and approximate range of catalytic performance over the IrO2 catalyst in ethane CL-ODH could be clearly clarified. In addition, the experimentally measured adsorption energy of ethane over the S-IrO2(110) surface is 65 kJ·mol–1, (28) which is comparable with our values with a ZPE correction of 46.6 kJ·mol–1 over the S-IrO2 catalyst; meanwhile, the adsorption energy of ethylene is 132–162 kJ·mol–1, which is also close to our calculated results with a ZPE correction of 129.8 kJ·mol–1 over the S-IrO2 catalyst; furthermore, their TPRS experiment showed that the selectivity of ethylene is 40%, which is close to the 47.42% at 750 K (Figure 6a) over the S-IrO2(110) surface in our study.
4.5. Event Frequency of the Ethane CL-ODH Process
To further understand the origin of catalytic performance difference, reveal the main reaction path of ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene, clarify formation path of CHx* (x = 1–3) and the coke precursor C* and the deactivation mechanism of S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 catalysts, and finally unravel the evolution process of the IrO2 surface state during ethane CL-ODH, the event frequency of all elementary reactions at 750 K is plotted in Figure 9. Furthermore, since the regeneration process over the R-IrO2 surface involves only one reaction, the event frequency of the regeneration process is not discussed here.
Figure 9
Figure 9. Event frequency of elementary steps involved in the ethane CL-ODH process over (a) S-IrO2 and (b) R-IrO2 catalysts at 750 K and P(C2H6) = 0.8 bar. Event frequencies of other reaction conditions over S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 catalysts are presented in Figures S5 and S6, respectively.
Over the S-IrO2 catalyst (Figure 9a), first, C2H6* adsorption and desorption processes are in an equilibrium state, and the event frequency of C2H6* dehydrogenation to C2H5* is larger by nearly 1 order of magnitude than that of its C–C bond cracking to CH3* + CH3*. Subsequently, the event frequency of C2H5* dehydrogenation to C2H4* is slightly larger than that of its C–C bond cracking to CH2* + CH3*; both are also larger than C2H5* dehydrogenation to CHCH3*. Next, for the C2H4* desorption process, the event frequency of C2H4* dehydrogenation to CHCH2* and its C–C bond cracking to CH2* + CH2* is zero, that is, all C2H4* intermediates desorbed to form C2H4(g). Moreover, CHCH3* dehydrogenation to CHCH2* shows a sufficient advantage over its dehydrogenation to CCH3* and C–C cracking to CH* + CH3*, so most CHCH3* intermediates are dehydrogenated to CHCH2*. Furthermore, the event frequency of CHCH2* dehydrogenation to CHCH* is superior to that of its dehydrogenation to CCH2* and C–C bond cracking to CH* + CH2* since the reverse event frequencies of the latter two reactions are zero. Notably, the event frequency of CHCH2* hydrogenation to C2H4* is nearly equal to that of CHCH2* dehydrogenation to CHCH*, and the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of CHCH2* are competitive. Furthermore, the event frequency of CHCH* dehydrogenation to CCH* is slightly greater than that of CHCH* desorption, which means that about half of all CHCH* species will undergo dehydrogenation to form CCH* and CC*, followed by the C–C bond cracking to C* and CH*. Based on the above-mentioned analysis, the two main paths for C2H4(g) formation over S-IrO2 at 750 K are C2H6* → C2H5* → C2H4* → C2H4(g) and C2H6* → C2H5* → CHCH3* → CHCH2* → C2H4* → C2H4(g). The byproduct CHCH(g) formation path is C2H6* → C2H5* → CHCH3* → CHCH2* → CHCH* → CHCH(g).
For CHx* (x = 0–3) generation over the S-IrO2 catalyst (Figure 9a), C2Hx* (x = 0–6) species with the C–C cracking are C2H6*, C2H5*, and CHCH3*, which agree with the DFT results of the precursor CHx* (x = 0–3) in Section 3.2.1. According to the kMC simulation results, as listed in Table S4, the formation rates (s–1·site–1) of C2H2(g), CO(g), and CO2(g) at 750 K are 8.47 × 104, 3.40 × 1010, and 7.46 × 1010, respectively. Meanwhile, event frequencies of CO* and CO2* desorption are larger than those of CHCH* desorption (Figure 9). kMC simulation results are consistent with the results obtained by TPRS experiments, (28) that is, the CO(g) and CO2(g) generation is more favorable than C2H2(g) formation. Furthermore, for the coke precursor C*, the event frequency of CH* → C* + H* is slightly larger than that of CO(g) and CO2(g) desorption, that is, once C* species are formed, most C* species will react with O2CN atoms to produce COx(g), and a few C* will remain on the surface to occupy “Ir5CN” sites. Thus, C* species may accumulate over the S-IrO2 surface, leading to catalyst deactivation. Moreover, the species coverage at 750 K (Figure 7i) shows that most “Ir5CN” sites are occupied by CHx* (x = 0–4), and event frequencies of C2H6* → CH3* + CH3*, C2H5* → CH2* + CH3*, and CH2* + H* → CH3* are much higher than those of CH3* + H* → CH4*, that is, the rapid generation of CH3* intermediates occupying “Ir5CN” active sites of ethane dehydrogenation cannot be further consumed and will accumulate in large amounts over the S-IrO2 catalyst, resulting in catalyst deactivation.
As presented in Figure 9a, event frequencies of H2O(g), CO(g), and CO2(g) generation, namely, the surface oxygen vacancy Ov generation, are 1.76 × 10–4, 1.57 × 10–5, and 3.67 × 10–7, respectively; meanwhile, event frequencies of Ov-1 → *, Ov-2 → *, and Ov-3 → * corresponding to the oxygen migration from the subsurface to the surface with different numbers of surface oxygen vacancies are 1.12 × 10–5, 1.29 × 10–4, and 8.46 × 10–6, respectively; thus, the average event frequencies of Ov generation are larger than those of oxygen migration from the subsurface to the surface. Moreover, the rates of H2O(g), CO(g), and CO2(g) generation are 6.85 × 1011, 3.40 × 1010, and 7.46 × 1010, respectively (Table S4), which are much larger than those of Ov-1 → *, Ov-2 → *, and Ov-3 → * (7.33 × 10–2, 3.92 × 104, and 2.35 × 108) (Table S21), that is, the rate of Ov generation is much higher than that of oxygen migration from the subsurface to the surface. These results confirm that the rate of oxygen migration from the bulk to the surface is lower than the consumption rate of surface lattice oxygen; as a result, the S-IrO2(110) surface is preferentially reduced and gradually converted to the R-IrO2(110) surface over time in ethane dehydrogenation.
Over the R-IrO2 catalyst (Figure 9b), the event frequency of C2H6* → C2H5* + H* is larger by nearly 5 orders of magnitude than that of C2H6* → CH3* + CH3*, so the C2H6* cracking reaction almost never happens. Then, C2H5* → CH2* + CH3* has plenty of advantages compared to C2H5* dehydrogenation to C2H4*/CHCH3*. Furthermore, the event frequency of CH3* dehydrogenation to CH2* is larger than that of its hydrogenation to CH4*, and the event frequency of CH2* + CH2* → C2H4* is larger by nearly 5 orders of magnitude than that of CH2* dehydrogenation to CH*. Namely, for CH2* and CH3* produced by C2H5* cracking, CH3* is first dehydrogenated to form CH2*, and then, two CH2* species are coupled to form C2H4*. Moreover, since event frequencies of CHCH3* → CCH3* + H* and CHCH3* → CH* + CH3* are zero, all CHCH3* dehydrogenates to produce CHCH2*. Then, event frequencies of CHCH2* → CCH2* + H* and CHCH2* → CH* + CH2* are zero and that of CHCH2* → CHCH* + H* is almost zero, so all CHCH2* intermediates are dominantly hydrogenated to produce C2H4*. Finally, event frequencies of C2H4* → CHCH2* + H* and C2H4* → CH2* + CH2* are zero, so all C2H4* desorbs to form C2H4(g). From the conversion analysis between CHCH3* and CHCH2*, it is observed that all CHCH3* species are converted into C2H4(g) via CHCH2* intermediates. Thus, the three main paths for C2H4(g) formation over the R-IrO2 catalyst at 750 K are C2H6* → C2H5* → C2H4* → C2H4(g), C2H6* → C2H5* → CHCH3* → CHCH2* → C2H4* → C2H4(g), and C2H6* → C2H5* → CH3* + CH2* → CH2* + CH2* → C2H4* → C2H4(g).
For CHx* (x = 0–3) formation, C2Hx* (x = 0–6) species with the C–C cracking correspond to C2H6* and C2H5*, and the event frequency of C2H5* → CH2* + CH3* is much larger than that of C2H6* → CH3* + CH3* (Figure 9b), so C2H5* is the main precursor to generate CHx* (x = 0–3), which is consistent with our DFT results of the precursor CHx* (x = 0–3) in Section 3.2.3. Then, the event frequency of CH4* desorption is larger by nearly 4 orders of magnitude than that of CHCH* desorption, so as listed in Table S24, the main byproduct gas is CH4(g) at 750 K over the R-IrO2 catalyst. Moreover, for the coke precursor C*, event frequencies of all C* formations are zero, which means that C* species will not accumulate over R-IrO2. Event frequencies of C2H6* → CH3* + CH3* and C2H5* → CH2* + CH3* are about 5 × 10–8 and 3.5 × 10–3, respectively, and that of CH3* + H → CH4* is 7 × 10–4. The sum of event frequencies for generating CH3* is much larger than that for consuming CH3*, which explains the decrease of TOF due to CH3* occupying active sites of ethane dehydrogenation over the R-IrO2 surface.
As presented in Figure 9, over S-IrO2, event frequencies of C2H5* → C2H4* + H, CHCH2* + H → C2H4*, and CH2* + CH2* → C2H4* are about 8 × 10–5, 1.5 × 10–5, and 8 × 10–7, respectively, the former two paths dominantly contribute to C2H4(g) TOF. However, over R-IrO2, as shown in Figure 9b, the event frequency of CH2* + CH2* → C2H4* is 3 × 10–3, which is much larger than that of C2H5* → C2H4* + H (1 × 10–4) and CHCH2* + H → C2H4* (1.5 × 10–5); thus, the existence of CH2* + CH2* → C2H4* dominantly contributes to C2H4(g) TOF. Furthermore, the event frequency of CH2* + CH2* → C2H4* (3 × 10–3) over R-IrO2 is also larger than that of C2H5* → C2H4* + H (8 × 10–5) and CHCH2* + H → C2H4* (1.5 × 10–5) over S-IrO2; as a result, C2H4(g) formation activity over R-IrO2 is much better than that over S-IrO2 at 750 K. Meanwhile, CH2* consumption promotes CH3* conversion over R-IrO2, resulting in more available ethane dehydrogenation “Ir5CN” active sites compared to those of S-IrO2. As a result, during 3000 s simulation time at 750 K, the C2H4(g) TOF decreases rapidly until deactivation (Figure S3h) over S-IrO2, while the C2H4(g) TOF first decreases rapidly and then remains stable around 0.004 s–1·site–1 over the R-IrO2 catalyst (Figure S4g). Although deactivation mechanisms of S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 catalysts are similar, the degree of deactivation varies greatly, which is attributed to the presence of O2CN atoms over the S-IrO2 catalyst, leading to more C2Hx* species cracking and CHx* species generation. These CHx* species are usually burnt away with the cycle of excess O2(g) as CO2(g).
Through the above-mentioned analysis, the differences in C2H4(g) formation activity and selectivity over S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 catalysts are well explained, the possible C2Hx* (x = 0–6) precursors to generate CHx* (x = 0–3) and the main gas byproduct are pointed out, the mechanisms of the coke precursor C* generation and transformation are clarified, and the difference in the deactivation degree over S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 catalysts is revealed. Most importantly, the rate and event frequency of surface Ov generation are faster than those of the oxygen migration from the subsurface to the surface. Thus, in ethane CL-ODH, due to the easy oxygen migration from the bulk to the surface, IrO2 as the oxygen carrier can act as a sufficient oxygen source for dehydrogenation. However, because the migration rate of the bulk oxygen to the surface is lower than the consumption rate of surface lattice oxygen, the IrO2 surface will be preferentially reduced and gradually converted to the R-IrO2 surface during long-term operation.
4.6. Proposed Mechanism
As mentioned above, the S-IrO2 catalyst shows only 47.42% C2H4(g) selectivity and poor C2H4(g) formation activity (1.81 × 10–4 s–1·site–1) due to the C–C bond cracking of C2Hx species and the generation of CO(g) and CO2(g). However, ethane direct dehydrogenation to C2H4(g) and H2(g) over the R-IrO2 catalyst exhibits excellent C2H4(g) formation activity (3.96 × 10–3 s–1·site–1) and selectivity (84.02%). Thus, starting from ethane dehydrogenation over the S-IrO2 catalyst, the presence of surface O2CN atoms shows low C2H4(g) selectivity, resulting in the formation of more CO(g) and CO2(g) at the beginning of ethane CL-ODH. As the dehydrogenation reaction proceeds, surface O2CN atoms are consumed, followed by lattice oxygen migration from the bulk to the surface, and then, the partially reduced R-IrO2 surface appears, which exhibits higher C2H4(g) formation activity and selectivity than those of the S-IrO2 catalyst. Meanwhile, the unavailability of ethane dehydrogenation “Ir5CN” active sites occupied by CH2* and CH3* species will directly lead to a decrease of C2H4(g) TOF and even catalyst deactivation. Through O2(g) oxidation, ethane dehydrogenation “Ir5CN” active sites become available again, so that the catalyst is regenerated to enter the next CL-ODH cycle. In the present study, the influence of surface states on the catalytic performance is clarified and proved, and the IrO2 catalyst could realize ethane CL-ODH to ethylene at a relatively low temperature (750 K).
Based on the above-mentioned analysis, the mechanism of ethane CL-ODH over the IrO2 catalyst is proposed and illustrated in Figure 10. Starting from the stoichiometric S-IrO2 catalyst, ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to produce C2H4(g), H2O(g), CO(g), and CO2(g), taking away surface lattice oxygen, leads to the partially reduced R-IrO2 surface. Namely, during the ethane CL-ODH process over the IrO2 catalyst, starting from the S-IrO2 catalyst, with the consumption of surface lattice oxygen and subsequent lattice oxygen migration from the bulk to the surface, the partially reduced IrO2 catalyst surface is first formed, both S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 surfaces simultaneously exist for the IrO2 catalyst, and C2H4(g) formation activity and selectivity are between S-IrO2 and R-IrO2, which presents an increasing trend with the increase of surface Ov sites and the reduction degree of the IrO2 surface. Meanwhile, the unavailability of ethane dehydrogenation “Ir5CN” active sites occupied by CH2* and CH3* species will directly lead to a decrease of C2H4(g) TOF and even catalyst deactivation, followed by the regeneration process carried out by burning CH2* and CH3* species together with oxygen replenishment, leading to the surface reconstruction of the IrO2 catalyst and then entering the next cycle of ethane CL-ODH.
Figure 10
Figure 10. Proposed mechanism of ethane CL-ODH over the IrO2 catalyst.
Interestingly, our results show that the IrO2 surface can be neither completely reduced in the dehydrogenation process nor completely oxidized in the regeneration process; subsequently, beginning with the second cycle of ethane CL-ODH, both S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 surfaces simultaneously exist, which exhibits better C2H4(g) selectivity and activity than that at the beginning of the first cycle; as the dehydrogenation reaction goes on, the unavailability of ethane dehydrogenation “Ir5CN” active sites occupied by CH2* and CH3* species will decrease the C2H4(g) TOF and even deactivate the catalyst, followed by the regeneration process. Furthermore, the second cycle of ethane CL-ODH is repeated to perform the next cycle, which can continuously realize ethane CL-ODH. Moreover, at the initial stage of ethane CL-ODH, the presence of surface O2CN atoms shows low C2H4(g) selectivity and increased cracking; then, after the surface O2CN atoms are taken away as H2O(g), CO(g), and CO2(g), the reduced surface exhibits an excellent C2H4(g) selectivity (84.02%). The fundamental understanding of the key steps in ethane CL-ODH and the research methods over the IrO2 catalyst can provide ideas and inspiration for the design and development of other alkane CL-ODH high-performance catalysts.
5. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Starting from the main challenge currently faced by ethane ODH, the present study investigates ethane CL-ODH over the IrO2 catalyst, which is expected to improve the C2H4(g) selectivity based on retaining the advantages of ODH. Due to the absence of timely oxygen replenishment during the dehydrogenation process, both the stoichiometric IrO2(110) and the reduced IrO2(110) with the removal of all surface O2CN atoms were constructed to present the two extreme states of the IrO2 surface structure under the realistic conditions. A complete reaction network was systematically investigated using DFT calculations and kMC simulations, including all the possibilities, totaling more than 30 reactions. The results show that the reaction mechanisms of ethane dehydrogenation over S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 catalysts are fundamentally different. First, over the S-IrO2 catalyst, H atoms from the dehydrogenation of the hydrocarbons are picked up by the surface O2CN atoms, which desorb in the form of H2O(g). However, over the R-IrO2 catalyst, H falling at the bridge sites of Ir4CN-Ir4CN will recombine into H2 and then desorb. Then, over the S-IrO2 catalyst, the coke precursor C* will react with lattice oxygen (O2CN) to generate CO(g) and CO2(g), but C* is not oxidized over the R-IrO2 catalyst. Furthermore, CO(g), CO2(g), and H2O(g) formation takes away the S-IrO2 surface O2CN atoms to form surface Ov, corresponding to the R-IrO2 surface. As the activity decreases, the regeneration process is carried out over R-IrO2; removing CHx* (x = 0–3) species occupying active sites, the R-IrO2 surface is reconstructed to the S-IrO2 surface. During the regeneration process, the conversion from R-IrO2 to the S-IrO2 surface is completed through the adsorption and dissociation of a large amount of O2(g).
Based on kMC simulation results, the optimal conditions of 750 K and 0.8 bar C2H6(g) pressure are obtained. C2H4(g) selectivity and TOF are 47.42% and 1.81 × 10–4 s–1·site–1 over the S-IrO2 catalyst and 84.02% and 3.96 × 10–3 s–1·site–1 over the R-IrO2 catalyst, respectively. After considering oxygen migration from the bulk to the surface, the maximum Ov concentration over the S-IrO2 surface is 0.272 and the oxidation degree over the R-IrO2 surface during the regeneration process is between 0.858 and 0.873, that is, the IrO2 catalyst can be neither completely reduced in the dehydrogenation process nor completely oxidized in the regeneration process; both S-IrO2 and R-IrO2 surfaces simultaneously exist, and the oxidative and nonoxidative dehydrogenations occur simultaneously; moreover, the minimum surface oxidation degree over the R-IrO2 surface is greater than the maximum Ov concentration over the S-IrO2 surface, so the oxidative regeneration process of the IrO2 catalyst is easily realized and completes the ethane CL-ODH cycle. Furthermore, the rates and event frequencies of surface Ov generation are faster than those of lattice oxygen migration from the bulk to the surface. Thus, for ethane CL-ODH over the IrO2 catalyst, with the lattice oxygen consumption, the first is oxidative dehydrogenation; then, oxidative dehydrogenation and nonoxidative dehydrogenation occur simultaneously over the partially reduced IrO2 surface; furthermore, the bulk lattice oxygen migrates toward the partially reduced catalyst surface to supply oxygen as reactants; finally, the catalyst surface may be reduced to metal Ir by C2H6(g). However, metal Ir is unfavorable for alkane activation. Thus, time control of the dehydrogenation process is very important for ethylene yield, and it is necessary to enter the regeneration process before the catalyst is over-reduced.
This study reveals that although C2H6 can be activated below 150 K over the IrO2 catalyst, it still needs 750 K to efficiently convert C2H6(g) to C2H4(g), which broadens the understanding of ethane CL-ODH over metal oxide catalysts and provides a reference for effective design and discovery of high-performance catalysts in alkane CL-ODH. In addition, the screening of high-performance catalysts for ethane CL-ODH from the perspective of theoretical simulation still needs further exploration and research.

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. Top (a, c) and side (b, d) views of the optimized configurations of S-IrO2(110) and R-IrO2(110) catalysts. The blue, red, and green balls denote Ir atoms, threefold coordinated O atoms (O3CN), and surface twofold coordinated O atoms (O2CN), respectively. The lattice (40 × 40) employed in kMC simulations, Ir5CN sites (purple squares) and O2CN sites (green circles) are considered over the S-IrO2(110) surface (e), and Ir5CN sites (purple squares) and Ir4CN–Ir4CN bridge (B-Ir4CN) sites (blue circles) are considered over the R-IrO2(110) surface (f).
